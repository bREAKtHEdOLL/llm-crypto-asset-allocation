2024-11-18 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several key developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing signs of a strong uptrend, bolstered by significant institutional purchases and positive technical indicators. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, with potential for a breakout, while Solana is benefiting from bullish sentiment and speculation around a potential ETF. Dogecoin has seen increased community activity and technical patterns suggesting a possible rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates growing demand for stablecoins, although the current market environment suggests a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout, coupled with accumulation signals, supports a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent price highs and positive sentiment around potential ETF developments make SOL a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community engagement and technical patterns hinting at a rally provide a slightly positive outlook, though with higher volatility.

USDT: -0.7 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable upward momentum in several key cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to show strong upward momentum, bolstered by significant institutional purchases and a positive technical outlook. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, with potential for a breakout as on-chain accumulation increases. Solana is experiencing a surge in price due to network strength and speculation around a potential ETF, reaching a three-year high. Dogecoin is also seeing positive sentiment, driven by community events and bullish technical patterns suggesting potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance indicates rising demand and liquidity, although the broader market's risk-on sentiment suggests a potential shift away from stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and a robust technical uptrend indicate further potential gains. Positive news and on-chain activity support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with signs of accumulation and reduced fees, suggesting potential for a breakout. Maintain a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent price surge and positive sentiment around potential ETF developments make Solana attractive. Continued network strength supports further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven events and bullish technical patterns suggest potential upside, though the risk remains higher compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite in the market, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-18 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, which may support risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase, and technical indicators suggest room for further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with rising exchange balances indicating potential accumulation. Solana is benefiting from bullish sentiment and ETF speculation, driving its price to a 3-year high. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for liquidity, but its role as a stablecoin suggests it might be less favored in a bullish crypto environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend support further gains, making BTC a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with accumulation signals; potential breakout could lead to significant upside.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment and ETF speculation are driving strong price action, making SOL attractive for increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, warranting moderate allocation increase.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital into higher growth potential assets."
2024-11-18 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of potential bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional buying from MicroStrategy and technical indicators suggesting further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with signs of accumulation as exchange reserves rise. Solana has reached a multi-year high, driven by network strength and ETF speculation, indicating robust investor interest. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns hinting at a potential rally, although on-chain activity remains relatively low. Tether continues to see demand, evidenced by new issuances, but its role as a stablecoin suggests it may see reduced allocation in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical indicators support further gains, making BTC a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching resistance with signs of accumulation; potential breakout could trigger a bullish wave.

SOL: +0.7 — Recent price surge and positive sentiment from ETF speculation suggest continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical patterns and community support, but lower on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish environment, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-18 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum and positive news catalysts.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bullish across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its sustained uptrend suggest continued investor confidence. Ethereum is nearing a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, and its exchange reserves are increasing, indicating accumulation. Solana is experiencing significant price gains driven by network strength and ETF speculation. Dogecoin has seen increased community activity and technical patterns suggest potential for a major rally. Tether's recent issuance indicates rising demand and liquidity support, although it remains a stable asset for risk-averse investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators. The recent large purchase by MicroStrategy reinforces long-term bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout. Increasing exchange reserves and decreasing fees suggest accumulation and positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.7 — Significant price gains and positive sentiment driven by network strength and ETF speculation. Technical indicators support continued bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased community activity and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, but current market conditions are less favorable compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-18 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, with notable upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price increase, supported by MicroStrategy's large purchase and strong technical indicators. Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout, with increased exchange reserves suggesting accumulation. Solana is benefiting from network strength and speculation around a potential ETF, driving its price to a multi-year high. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest due to community events and bullish technical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with recent minting indicating strong demand. Overall, the market is showing signs of risk-on behavior, with investors favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant institutional buying and technical indicators supporting further gains. The macroeconomic environment is also conducive to risk-on assets, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is nearing a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees suggest positive sentiment and potential for further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's price is near a 3-year high, driven by strong network fundamentals and ETF speculation. The bullish sentiment and technical indicators support continued upward movement.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin is benefiting from community-driven events and bullish technical patterns, indicating potential for further gains. However, the speculative nature warrants a slightly cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing a risk-on sentiment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets. The recent minting suggests liquidity support, but the overall environment favors cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-18 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

Bitcoin's recent significant purchase by MicroStrategy and its continued uptrend suggest confidence in its long-term value, while Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level that could trigger further gains. Solana is experiencing a surge due to network strength and speculation around a potential ETF, indicating strong investor interest. Dogecoin has seen a community-driven boost, with analysts predicting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests rising demand for liquidity, although its technical indicators show no immediate bullish signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators. The macroeconomic context is favorable for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout, supported by rising reserves and decreasing fees, indicating accumulation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment driven by network strength and ETF speculation, with technical indicators showing continued bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community engagement and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, but current price action is mixed.

2024-11-18 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum supported by significant news developments. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its continued uptrend suggest further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with increased exchange reserves indicating accumulation. Solana is experiencing a surge, driven by network strength and speculation about a potential ETF, while Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Tether's recent issuance indicates rising demand, but its role as a stablecoin suggests it may see reduced allocation in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum, significant institutional buying, and positive technical indicators support a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching key resistance with signs of accumulation; potential breakout could trigger further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Network strength and ETF speculation are driving price gains, making it attractive in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though less certain than other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-18 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with strong upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its sustained uptrend suggest continued confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, indicating potential for a breakout, while Solana continues to gain on network strength and ETF speculation. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm, though its technical patterns suggest potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates rising demand for liquidity, though its role as a stablecoin suggests a more conservative allocation in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and recent large-scale institutional purchases. The bullish sentiment and potential for further gains make BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees support a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued price gains and positive sentiment driven by ETF speculation and network strength. The asset is well-positioned for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community enthusiasm and potential technical rally provide a modest bullish outlook, though less compelling than other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in a bullish market, serving as a liquidity anchor rather than a growth asset."
2024-11-18 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing strong technical indicators and positive news developments. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its firm uptrend suggest continued bullish momentum. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, although recent price declines may temper immediate enthusiasm. Solana is benefiting from strong network performance and speculation around a potential ETF, driving its price to a multi-year high. Dogecoin, buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns, shows potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance indicates rising demand for liquidity, although its role as a stablecoin may see reduced preference in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and significant institutional investment suggest continued bullish momentum. The macroeconomic environment is not overly bearish, supporting risk-on assets like BTC.

ETH: +0.5 — While recent price declines are notable, the potential for a breakout at $3,130 and accumulation signals from exchange reserves suggest a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from network performance and ETF speculation, along with strong technical indicators, make SOL an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns indicating a potential rally provide a moderate buy signal, although the recent price drop suggests some caution.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of bullishness, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-18 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by significant institutional purchases and a firm uptrend in technical indicators. Ethereum is on the verge of a potential breakout, with increasing exchange reserves suggesting accumulation. Solana has reached a multi-year high, driven by network strength and ETF speculation, indicating strong investor interest. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns hinting at a rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests rising demand for liquidity, although its technical indicators are less favorable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and a firm uptrend support a bullish outlook. On-chain activity remains healthy, reinforcing positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees are positive indicators.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching a 3-year high with strong network performance and ETF speculation driving interest. Positive momentum and volume support further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and potential for a technical rally provide moderate bullish sentiment. However, recent price decreases warrant caution.

USDT: 0.0 — While recent minting indicates demand, the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggests a neutral stance."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could influence crypto markets by affecting risk sentiment. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional purchases, such as MicroStrategy's recent acquisition, reinforcing its long-term bullish outlook. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, with potential for a breakout, though recent increases in exchange reserves suggest mixed sentiment. Solana is experiencing strong bullish sentiment driven by network strength and ETF speculation. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm, but technical indicators suggest potential for a significant rally. Tether's recent minting indicates rising demand for stablecoins, though its role as a safe haven may diminish if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and technical uptrend suggest further gains. Positive news flow and on-chain activity bolster confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout. Mixed signals from exchange reserves, but overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong price action and ETF speculation drive bullish sentiment. Network strength supports further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.1 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest possible rally, but overall sentiment remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation away from stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-18 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its firm uptrend suggest continued investor confidence and potential for further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, while Solana is experiencing strong bullish sentiment driven by network strength and ETF speculation. Dogecoin is seeing community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns indicating potential for a rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance reflects rising demand and liquidity support, although it remains a stable asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional buying and technical uptrend. Positive news and on-chain activity reinforce bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees suggest positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong price performance and bullish sentiment driven by network strength and ETF speculation. Positive technical indicators support further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though less robust than other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-18 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin continues to demonstrate strong upward momentum, bolstered by significant institutional purchases and a robust technical uptrend. Ethereum is on the cusp of a potential breakout, with increasing exchange reserves suggesting accumulation. Solana is experiencing a surge in interest due to speculation around an ETF and strong network fundamentals. Dogecoin, while seeing community-driven enthusiasm, lacks strong technical backing for a major rally. Tether's recent minting activity indicates rising demand and liquidity support, but the market's risk appetite seems to be shifting towards more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest further gains. On-chain activity supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout. Accumulation signals are positive, though not as strong as BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and network strength. Recent price surge supports continued interest.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite community enthusiasm, technical indicators do not strongly support a major rally at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-18 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by strong upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is buoyed by significant institutional purchases and a robust uptrend, while Ethereum is on the cusp of a potential breakout, supported by increasing reserves and reduced network fees. Solana is experiencing a surge due to network strength and ETF speculation, reaching new highs. Dogecoin is seeing community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates increasing demand for liquidity, though its stable nature makes it less attractive in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong uptrend, significant institutional buying, and increased on-chain activity suggest further gains, making it a high-priority asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's approach to a breakout and accumulation signals a bullish outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent price surge and positive sentiment from ETF speculation support a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While not as strong as other assets, Dogecoin's community activity and potential rally path justify a moderate positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with strong upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its continued uptrend suggest further potential gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, indicating a possible breakout. Solana has been performing well, driven by network strength and speculation around a potential ETF. Dogecoin has seen increased community activity, but its technical indicators remain mixed. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance and investment in compliance suggest strong demand and liquidity support, although the broader market trend favors riskier assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and significant institutional investment suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with bullish momentum; potential for breakout supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network performance and ETF speculation provide a bullish outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community engagement and potential rally signals are positive, but technical indicators are less convincing.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-18 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by positive developments and technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by significant institutional purchases and technical uptrends. Ethereum is on the brink of a potential breakout, with increasing exchange balances suggesting accumulation. Solana continues to benefit from bullish sentiment and ETF speculation, although recent price decreases indicate some caution. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm but lacks strong technical backing for a significant rally. Tether's recent issuance suggests increased demand for liquidity, but the broader market's risk appetite is shifting towards more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest further gains. On-chain activity supports bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout. Accumulation signals are positive, though recent price decrease warrants caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite recent price decreases, strong network fundamentals and ETF speculation provide a supportive backdrop.

DOGE: 0.0 — Community enthusiasm is high, but lacking strong technical signals for a major rally. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-18 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent purchase by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend suggest continued investor confidence. Ethereum is approaching a breakout level, supported by rising exchange reserves and decreasing fees, which indicates potential accumulation. Solana is experiencing strong bullish sentiment, driven by ETF speculation and network strength. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's minting activity indicates rising demand for stablecoins, although the broader market's risk appetite may lead to capital rotation into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong uptrend, significant purchase by MicroStrategy, and bullish technical indicators support a high allocation preference.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's potential breakout and accumulation signals, along with decreasing fees, suggest a positive outlook, though slightly less strong than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent price surge and ETF speculation create a favorable environment, though technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns hint at potential gains, but the overall sentiment is less robust compared to BTC and ETH.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's bullish sentiment, there's a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, despite the recent minting activity indicating demand."
2024-11-18 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant developments supporting upward trends in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by MicroStrategy's substantial purchase and technical indicators suggesting further gains. Ethereum is on the cusp of a breakout, with increasing exchange balances and reduced fees indicating accumulation. Solana continues to benefit from bullish sentiment and speculation around a potential ETF, pushing it near historical highs. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates rising demand and liquidity support, although its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive allocation in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from recent large-scale purchases and technical indicators, suggesting continued upward momentum. 

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance with potential for a breakout, supported by accumulation signals and reduced fees.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and recent price highs, although lacking immediate technical buy signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns hinting at a potential rally, though less compelling than BTC and ETH.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-18 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong technical signals and positive news catalysts. Bitcoin's recent large purchase by MicroStrategy and its ongoing uptrend suggest continued bullish momentum. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout supported by increasing reserves and decreasing fees. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment, driven by network strength and ETF speculation, although its technical indicators are less supportive. Dogecoin has seen mixed activity, with community-driven events and speculative price targets, but recent price volatility suggests caution. Tether's new issuance indicates rising demand for liquidity, but its role remains primarily as a stable asset in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by large institutional purchases and positive technical indicators. The macroeconomic context is stable, favoring continued investment in BTC.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Increasing exchange reserves and decreasing fees suggest accumulation and bullish sentiment.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news and sentiment around network strength and ETF speculation, but technical indicators are not yet fully supportive of a strong buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite community-driven events and speculative targets, recent price volatility and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-11-19 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by Bitcoin's recent all-time high and strong performance across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500 has been supported by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, while facing bearish sentiment from some analysts, continues to show strong fundamentals, particularly with the introduction of staking rewards. Solana is demonstrating ecosystem strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap milestone. Dogecoin has shown impressive performance, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a possible rally to $1. Meanwhile, Tether experienced a security breach, but this has not significantly impacted market confidence in the stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF-related news and a recent all-time high, suggests continued bullishness. The positive macroeconomic sentiment further enhances its appeal.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite some bearish sentiment, Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong, particularly with the introduction of staking rewards. The recent price volatility offers potential for upside.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate robust ecosystem strength, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's recent rally and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains, though the current price level warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While the security breach is concerning, the stablecoin's role as a safe haven remains unchanged. Given the bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent."
2024-11-19 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high, driven by favorable macroeconomic factors and crypto-friendly political developments. Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals, faces bearish sentiment due to doubts about revisiting its yearly highs. Solana shows strong ecosystem growth with record DEX volumes and increased market cap, while Dogecoin is experiencing a bullish breakout pattern with potential for significant gains. Tether faces security concerns due to a recent wallet breach, but no customer funds were affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and favorable policy expectations suggest strong upward momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, bearish sentiment and doubts about price recovery warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong ecosystem growth and market cap increase make Solana attractive, despite mixed technical signals.

DOGE: +0.6 — Bullish breakout pattern and recent price surge indicate potential for further gains, supported by positive market sentiment.

USDT: -0.3 — With rising risk appetite and strong performance in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is justified."
2024-11-19 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. Bitcoin has recently hit an all-time high, driven by optimism surrounding crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum is facing bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, while Solana is experiencing significant growth in its decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes and market cap. Dogecoin has shown a strong rally with potential for further gains, while Tether has faced a security breach but remains stable. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a focus on growth assets like BTC and SOL, while maintaining some caution with ETH and DOGE due to mixed signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive sentiment from ETF developments suggest strong upward momentum. The recent surge in on-chain activity supports further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, bearish investor sentiment and recent price decreases warrant a neutral stance. The market appears uncertain about ETH's immediate direction.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate robust ecosystem health, making SOL an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price breakout and bullish news suggest potential for further gains. However, the volatility requires a measured approach.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-19 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a bullish sentiment, particularly for Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions and positive ETF news, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin is experiencing a significant rally, with technical indicators suggesting potential for further gains. Ethereum, while fundamentally strong, is facing bearish sentiment from analysts, which may dampen its near-term performance. Solana continues to demonstrate ecosystem strength with high DEX volumes, and its market cap growth reflects increasing adoption. Tether remains stable but faces scrutiny due to a recent security breach, which may impact its perceived safety as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive ETF news, coupled with strong on-chain activity, suggest continued upward momentum. It remains a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and recent price declines suggest a cautious approach. Hold current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate robust ecosystem health, making it an attractive investment in the current bullish market.

DOGE: +0.7 — Technical indicators and bullish sentiment point to potential for significant gains. The recent rally and breakout pattern support increased allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, reduce exposure to stablecoins to free up capital for more promising opportunities."
2024-11-19 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing significant bullish momentum. Bitcoin's recent surge past $93,500 is driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies, while Dogecoin's rally is supported by a potential bullish breakout pattern. Ethereum's sentiment remains bearish despite strong fundamentals, and Solana is experiencing strong ecosystem growth with record DEX volumes. The macroeconomic context indicates a stable environment with moderate volatility, which supports risk-on sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news about reaching an all-time high suggest continued bullish sentiment. The ETF-related news further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and recent price declines suggest caution. The addition of staking to ETH ETP is a positive development but not enough to offset the bearish sentiment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem strength, as evidenced by record DEX volumes and surpassing major companies in market cap, indicates a positive outlook. The recent price increase and bullish momentum support this view.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential for further gains, as indicated by bullish breakout patterns, suggest a strong buy signal. The recent price surge supports this positive sentiment.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macroeconomic environment, there is no immediate need to allocate towards USDT. The focus remains on risk assets given the current market conditions."
2024-11-19 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has recently hit an all-time high, driven by optimism around potential crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. This positive sentiment is further supported by Grayscale's ETF developments. Dogecoin is experiencing a rally, with analysts predicting significant potential upside. Meanwhile, Ethereum faces bearish investor sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Solana continues to show strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a high market cap. Tether, while stable, has been affected by a recent security breach, although it hasn't impacted customer funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments and all-time high prices support a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic environment is also favorable for risk assets.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and recent sideways technical indicators suggest caution. The lack of a clear bullish catalyst tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record DEX volumes and high market cap indicate robust ecosystem growth, supporting a positive allocation. The recent price breakout adds to the bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for significant upside, as indicated by bullish breakout patterns, make it an attractive allocation. The market sentiment is strongly positive.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there's less need to hold stablecoins like USDT. The recent security breach also adds a slight negative sentiment."
2024-11-19 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500 is driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results, and Grayscale's ETF developments further bolster its appeal. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about revisiting its yearly highs. Solana continues to demonstrate ecosystem strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap, while Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for further gains highlight its growing market interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by all-time high prices and positive ETF news, suggests continued growth potential.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals warrant caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Record DEX volumes and a strong market cap position Solana favorably for further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent rally and bullish breakout pattern indicate potential for continued upward movement.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin remains a neutral hold as the market shows mixed risk appetite, with no immediate need for increased exposure."
2024-11-19 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Solana showing strong ecosystem growth. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500 is driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies, while Solana's DEXs hitting record volumes and surpassing major corporations in market cap highlight its growing prominence. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Dogecoin shows potential for significant gains based on bullish breakout patterns. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and bullish momentum signals, coupled with positive news about potential crypto-friendly policies, suggest a strong upward trajectory.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals warrant a cautious approach, especially given its current portfolio weight.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong market cap growth and DEX activity indicate robust ecosystem strength, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While recent price decreases are noted, the potential for a significant rally and bullish sentiment provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite recent security concerns, USDT remains stable. Given the current market optimism, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent to allow for flexibility in reallocating capital."
2024-11-19 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, supported by positive macroeconomic developments and crypto-friendly policies. Bitcoin's strong momentum is further bolstered by Grayscale's ETF share split, enhancing its market appeal. Ethereum, however, faces bearish investor sentiment despite its strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about revisiting yearly highs. Solana continues to show strength with record DEX volumes and surpassing major companies in market cap, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin has experienced a significant rally with potential for further gains, driven by a bullish breakout pattern. Meanwhile, Tether faces challenges with a recent security breach, but no customer funds were affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments support a continued bullish outlook for Bitcoin. The asset's recent all-time high further reinforces confidence in its upward trajectory.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and sideways technicals suggest a neutral stance for Ethereum. The lack of a clear bullish signal warrants caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's robust ecosystem growth, record DEX volumes, and positive market cap developments indicate a favorable environment for further gains. The asset's strength relative to other cryptocurrencies supports a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for further gains suggest a moderately positive outlook. However, the lack of significant long-term developments tempers the enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on growth opportunities in more volatile assets."
2024-11-19 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and positive developments in the cryptocurrency space, such as Grayscale's ETF share split. However, there are mixed signals for Ethereum, with bearish investor sentiment despite strong fundamentals. Solana continues to show strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap increase, while Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, supported by bullish patterns. Tether faced a security breach, but it hasn't affected customer funds, and there are potential regulatory tailwinds with a Tether partner being nominated for a government position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and strong on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, supported by positive ETF news.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and technical indicators suggest caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate robust demand, justifying increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rally and bullish patterns suggest potential for further gains, but maintain moderate exposure due to volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, reduce stablecoin holdings to allocate capital to growth opportunities."
2024-11-19 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high driven by expectations of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts doubt a revisit to its yearly high. Solana is experiencing strong ecosystem growth, evidenced by record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap increase. Dogecoin has shown notable bullish momentum, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether has faced security issues but remains stable, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news about ETF developments support a bullish stance. The recent all-time high indicates strong market confidence.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite Ethereum's strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest a neutral position for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive DEX volume and market cap growth, along with bullish technical indicators, make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for further gains, as indicated by bullish patterns, warrant a positive allocation despite its volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities."

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish developments and technical signals across various cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has recently hit an all-time high, driven by optimism around crypto-friendly policies, while Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals. Solana is experiencing strong ecosystem growth, evidenced by record DEX volumes and a significant market cap increase. Dogecoin has shown strong price momentum, with analysts predicting further gains. Meanwhile, Tether has faced a security breach, but it hasn't affected customer funds. The macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility, with stable oil and gold prices, and a strong U.S. dollar, which may influence risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments support a bullish outlook. The recent all-time high suggests continued investor interest.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals warrant caution. The market appears to be rotating away from ETH.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's ecosystem strength, as evidenced by high DEX volumes and market cap growth, supports a positive outlook. Technical indicators also remain favorable.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains. Positive sentiment and technical signals support an increased allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the recent security breach, USDT remains stable. Given the mixed market sentiment, maintaining a neutral position in stablecoins is prudent."
2024-11-19 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing significant upward momentum. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500 is bolstered by hopes for crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite its strong fundamentals and new staking opportunities. Solana continues to demonstrate ecosystem strength with record DEX volumes and a high market cap, while Dogecoin is experiencing a notable rally with potential for further gains. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news, including its all-time high and ETF developments, make it highly attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a hold position for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record DEX volumes and high market cap indicate strong ecosystem growth, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's significant rally and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains, supporting an increased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market sentiment being bullish, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-11-19 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing significant upward momentum. Bitcoin's surge is supported by positive news regarding crypto-friendly policies and ETF developments, while Dogecoin's rally is driven by a bullish breakout pattern. Solana is also experiencing strong ecosystem growth, as evidenced by record trading volumes on its DEXs and a high market cap. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite its strong fundamentals, and Tether has been impacted by a security breach, although no customer funds were affected. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators, suggests continued growth potential. The breakout above the Bollinger Bands indicates a possible sustained rally.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite strong fundamentals, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment and lacks technical buy signals. The absence of upward momentum and investor skepticism warrant caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem strength, as shown by high DEX volumes and market cap, combined with positive technical signals, supports a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and bullish breakout pattern, along with positive sentiment, indicate potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing a preference for riskier assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, especially given the recent security breach news."
2024-11-19 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which has reached an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism over potential crypto-friendly U.S. policies. Bitcoin's technical indicators and on-chain activity support this bullish outlook. Solana also shows strong market performance, with significant DEX volume and a high market cap, indicating robust ecosystem activity. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, with analysts suggesting potential for further gains. In contrast, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Tether has experienced a security breach, though it did not affect customer funds. The macroeconomic context, with a stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong technical indicators, recent all-time high, and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's robust ecosystem activity and positive market developments, such as high DEX volumes, support a favorable outlook, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rally and bullish breakout pattern potential indicate positive sentiment, but given its volatility, a moderate increase in allocation is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish market sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing USDT exposure aligns with the current risk-on environment."
2024-11-19 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market sentiment is generally bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions and positive news such as the Grayscale ETF share split. Dogecoin has also shown strong performance, with analysts predicting further gains. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Solana's technical indicators suggest caution despite its impressive DEX volume and market cap achievements. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, which supports a risk-on sentiment, but the recent theft of USDT highlights potential vulnerabilities in stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by all-time high prices and positive ETF news, makes it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest reducing exposure to Ethereum.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana's technical indicators are mixed, its strong ecosystem growth and market cap achievements provide a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent price rally and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With a risk-on sentiment prevailing and recent theft concerns, reducing exposure to USDT in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-11-19 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by expectations of crypto-friendly policies following the U.S. election. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Solana shows ecosystem strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap. Dogecoin has experienced a recent rally, with potential for further gains, while Tether faces concerns over a recent wallet breach, although no customer funds were affected. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could influence crypto market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive news regarding ETF developments suggest strong upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals warrant a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

SOL: +0.5 — Record DEX volumes and a strong market cap position Solana favorably, indicating potential for growth and capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent rally and bullish breakout potential suggest moderate upside, but caution is advised due to recent price volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market optimism and potential for further crypto gains, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a liquidity buffer without immediate need for increased exposure."
2024-11-19 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism around crypto-friendly policies post-U.S. elections. Bitcoin's technical indicators are showing strong buy signals, supported by high on-chain activity. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to revisit yearly highs. Solana continues to show ecosystem strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap milestone. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge, with analysts predicting further potential gains. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, as no customer funds were affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with positive news and technical indicators, making it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and sideways technicals suggest holding current positions without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate a favorable environment for further capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rally and bullish sentiment suggest potential for further gains, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on market opportunities."
2024-11-20 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by political developments and ETF optimism, while Ethereum has broken the $3K mark with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing bullish potential with ETF filings and analyst predictions of significant price increases. Dogecoin has experienced volatility due to political speculation, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in key indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. The macro environment is stable, and BTC's price is approaching significant psychological levels.

ETH: +0.5 — Recent price surge past $3K and potential for further gains make ETH attractive, although technical indicators are mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from ETF filings and bullish price predictions, despite current technical signals not showing immediate strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — Political speculation has caused volatility, but no clear directional trend is established in the current data.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to allocate capital to more promising opportunities."
2024-11-20 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant news events and technical indicators. Bitcoin's price is nearing $95K, bolstered by positive news such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, which is reflected in Acurx Pharmaceuticals' allocation to BTC. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential upward momentum supported by a Grayscale ETF share split. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment, with a potential ETF filing and analysts predicting significant price increases. Dogecoin has seen speculative price swings due to political hype, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, indicating a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and institutional interest. The pro-crypto political environment and ETF optimism further enhance its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.3 — Breaking the $3K level and potential upward movement towards $3,800 provide a positive outlook, although technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment driven by ETF filing and analyst predictions of significant price increases. Technical indicators are neutral, but news supports a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative price swings and political hype, technical indicators do not suggest a clear direction, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, there is less need for stablecoin exposure, suggesting a rotation out of USDT."
2024-11-20 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by positive news such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains, while Solana is also experiencing bullish sentiment with ETF filings and predictions of significant price increases. Dogecoin has seen volatility due to political speculation, while Tether continues to expand its supply in anticipation of increased market demand. Despite these positive developments, technical indicators for most assets remain mixed, suggesting a need for careful allocation to balance potential gains with risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong news-driven momentum with institutional interest and ETF optimism, but technical indicators are mixed.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive price movement and potential for further gains, though technicals are still not fully supportive.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from ETF news and price predictions, despite current technical weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — Volatility driven by political speculation, but lacking strong technical or fundamental support for a directional move.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment leans bullish, capital rotation away from stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-20 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by positive news related to political developments and ETF optimism. Ethereum has also shown strength, breaking the $3K barrier with potential for further gains. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment with ETF filings and predictions of significant price increases. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to political associations, though its price remains volatile. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting of 1B USDT suggests anticipation of increased market demand, possibly as a safe haven amid these developments. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF optimism and institutional interest. The price is nearing significant psychological levels, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive price movement past $3K and potential for further gains. The recent ETF share split could attract more institutional interest, supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment driven by ETF filings and technical patterns suggesting significant upside. The asset shows potential for strong performance relative to others.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest due to political associations provides some upside potential, but volatility remains high, warranting a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns elsewhere."

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in price driven by pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals' treasury allocation. Ethereum has broken the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, supported by ETF-related activities. Solana is also gaining traction with ETF filings and bullish price predictions. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political speculation, while Tether continues to expand its supply in anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment, favoring strategic allocations into growth-oriented assets while maintaining some defensive positions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF optimism are driving positive sentiment and price momentum. The macroeconomic environment supports further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking the $3,000 level and ETF developments provide a bullish outlook, although technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news from ETF filings and bullish price predictions suggest potential for further gains, despite neutral technical signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Political speculation and recent price spikes indicate potential for short-term gains, but volatility remains high.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether is expanding supply, the current market environment favors risk assets, suggesting a neutral stance on stablecoins."
2024-11-20 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a cautiously optimistic sentiment, driven by significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing $95K, buoyed by pro-crypto political developments and ETF optimism, while Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains. Solana is also experiencing bullish momentum with ETF proposals and price predictions suggesting a strong upward trajectory. Dogecoin has seen speculative interest, partly due to political associations, but lacks strong technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting of 1 billion USDT suggests anticipation of increased market activity, although its role as a stablecoin may see reduced demand if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment from ETF optimism and pro-crypto political developments, coupled with increasing on-chain activity, supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K level and potential for further gains, along with recent ETF-related developments, provide a moderately positive signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive news from ETF proposals and bullish price predictions indicate strong potential for upward movement, justifying increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative interest and political associations, the lack of technical support and mixed sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-20 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by positive news around Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains as institutional interest grows. Solana is also showing bullish potential with ETF filings and price predictions suggesting significant upward movement. Dogecoin has experienced volatility due to political speculation, while Tether continues to see strong demand with a recent large minting on Ethereum. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, supporting a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news around ETF optimism and institutional adoption suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's break above $3K and bullish sentiment from ETF developments support a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's potential for significant price increases and ETF-related news provide a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, political speculation and increased trading activity provide some upside potential.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-20 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by positive news and developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in price due to favorable news, including Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, pushing it close to $95K. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a move toward $3,800. Solana is also seeing bullish sentiment with ETF filings and predictions of significant price increases. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political speculation, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging capital allocation into cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. Price nearing $95K indicates further potential for gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive momentum with price breaking $3K and potential for further upside. ETF developments add to bullish sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment driven by ETF filings and price predictions. Positive technical indicators suggest further growth potential.

DOGE: +0.2 — Political speculation and recent price swings create opportunities, but volatility remains high, warranting cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation away from stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-20 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, which have positively impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is nearing $95K, supported by institutional interest and treasury allocations. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing bullish potential with ETF filings and price predictions suggesting a move towards $4,000. Dogecoin experienced volatility due to political news but lacks strong technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests preparation for increased market demand, although its role as a stablecoin remains defensive in nature.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong institutional interest and positive news, including ETF optimism and treasury allocations. The technical indicators also show bullish momentum, supporting a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's recent price surge past $3K and bullish momentum indicators, along with positive news about ETF developments, suggest continued upward potential, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is experiencing positive sentiment with ETF filings and bullish price predictions. Although technical indicators are mixed, the overall outlook is favorable, justifying a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political news causing price swings, technical indicators do not support a strong buy or sell signal. The asset remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, holding USDT is less attractive. However, a complete exit is not advisable given its role as a hedge."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong macroeconomic indicators and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing new highs, fueled by optimism around a pro-crypto political environment and institutional interest. Ethereum has broken the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, while Solana is also showing bullish patterns with ETF interest. Dogecoin is experiencing price volatility due to political speculation, and Tether is expanding its supply in anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic context, with a stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging investment in cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news, including institutional adoption and political support, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking the $3,000 barrier and positive ETF developments provide a bullish outlook, although slightly tempered by recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish technical patterns and ETF interest indicate potential for significant upside, despite no immediate buy signals from trend indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — Political speculation is driving interest, but technical indicators remain neutral, suggesting cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-20 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $95K following Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has also shown strength, breaking the $3K mark with potential for further gains. Solana is experiencing positive momentum with ETF filings and bullish price predictions. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to political developments involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether has increased its supply, indicating potential market demand. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a favorable backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. Positive technical indicators and news sentiment suggest further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking through key price levels with bullish momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments. Potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment driven by ETF filings and positive price predictions. Technical indicators are improving, suggesting potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest due to political developments, but lacking strong technical support. Moderate allocation warranted.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin demand remains steady, but with increasing risk appetite, no significant allocation change is needed."
2024-11-20 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum due to favorable news, including Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, which is pushing prices towards $95K. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing bullish patterns, with ETF filings and optimistic price targets. Dogecoin, however, is experiencing volatility with political news but lacks strong technical support. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are less attractive as investors seek higher returns from riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news, including institutional interest and ETF optimism, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking the $3K level and positive technical indicators make ETH attractive, though slightly less so than BTC due to less impactful news.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish technical momentum and ETF-related news provide a positive outlook, though price targets remain speculative.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite political news creating buzz, technical indicators are weak, and recent price decreases suggest caution.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into riskier assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-20 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing the $95K mark, driven by positive news such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, while Ethereum has broken past $3K, with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing strength with ETF filings and bullish price predictions, though it lacks a clear buy signal from technical indicators. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political speculation, but lacks strong technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity, though its role remains as a stable asset amid these fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators. The potential for further gains makes it a preferred asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's recent price surge and positive news sentiment suggest continued bullish potential, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana has positive news and bullish momentum, the lack of a clear buy signal from trend indicators tempers enthusiasm slightly, but it remains attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price swings and speculative interest, Dogecoin lacks strong technical or news-driven support, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall market sentiment leaning bullish, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $95K due to positive news around Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has also broken past the $3,000 mark, with expectations of further upward movement. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum with ETF filings and price predictions suggesting further gains. Dogecoin is seeing volatility due to political developments and speculation. The macroeconomic context, with a stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, suggesting a shift away from stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding institutional interest and ETF optimism support further gains. On-chain activity is robust, indicating healthy market participation.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking past $3,000 with bullish sentiment and technical indicators suggests potential for further appreciation. The Grayscale ETF news adds to the positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive news around ETF filings and price targets support a favorable outlook. Recent technical indicators also show a shift towards a buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price swings and speculative interest, the lack of strong technical signals and mixed news sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-20 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic indicators and strong news developments. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in price due to pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, with a significant price increase nearing $95K. Ethereum has broken past the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, supported by ETF-related news. Solana is also showing bullish patterns with potential ETF developments, while Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political news and speculation. The stablecoin USDT remains stable, with recent minting indicating anticipation of increased market demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding institutional adoption and political support suggest continued price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking the $3,000 barrier and ETF developments provide a positive outlook, though slightly less momentum than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish technical indicators and ETF filing news support a positive allocation, though not as strong as BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political news causing volatility, there is no clear directional trend or strong technical signal to justify an allocation change.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-11-20 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments and optimism around cryptocurrency ETFs and pro-crypto political stances. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, fueled by institutional interest and favorable political developments. Ethereum has broken significant price levels, with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing bullish patterns with ETF news adding to its positive outlook. Dogecoin has seen volatility due to political news, but lacks strong technical support. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, which might limit some upside potential. However, the bullish sentiment in crypto markets is currently outweighing these macro factors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong bullish momentum, both technically and from news about institutional interest and political support. This makes it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent price surge past $3,000 and potential for further gains, along with ETF developments, support a positive allocation, though not as strong as BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive technical signals and ETF news suggest a favorable outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite political news-driven volatility, Dogecoin lacks strong technical support, and recent price decreases suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current bullish sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is advisable, as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-11-20 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and ETF optimism. On-chain activity remains robust, indicating continued interest and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Ethereum's technical indicators and bullish news suggest potential for upward movement, though with some caution due to recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment driven by ETF news and bullish price predictions. Recent price decrease may offer a buying opportunity given the overall bullish outlook.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent volatility and lack of strong technical signals suggest caution. While speculative interest remains, the lack of clear bullish momentum warrants a reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin demand remains steady, with recent minting activity indicating potential liquidity needs. No strong signals to increase or decrease exposure significantly."
2024-11-20 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by significant developments such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, which have positively impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K and Ethereum's rise above $3K signal strong market interest and potential for further gains. Solana also shows bullish potential with ETF filings and analyst predictions of substantial price increases. However, Dogecoin's recent price swings appear more speculative, driven by political hype rather than solid market fundamentals. The macroeconomic environment remains supportive, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, although the U.S. dollar's strength could pose some headwinds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news, including Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, support further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the bullish sentiment and potential for further upside, as indicated by breaking the $3K level, justify a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish news with ETF filings and analyst predictions of a significant price increase provide a supportive backdrop for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some speculative interest, the lack of strong technical or fundamental support suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of upward momentum and positive news catalysts. Bitcoin is benefiting from ETF optimism and institutional interest, while Ethereum is gaining traction after breaking the $3,000 mark. Solana is also experiencing bullish sentiment, driven by ETF filings and price predictions. However, Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with no clear directional trend, and USDT remains stable with increased minting activity, indicating potential demand for liquidity. Overall, the market is leaning towards a risk-on environment, but caution is warranted due to mixed technical signals and macroeconomic factors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news regarding ETF optimism and institutional adoption. Bitcoin's upward momentum is supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, Ethereum's recent price surge and positive news about ETF developments provide a bullish outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment driven by ETF filing and optimistic price targets. Despite recent price decreases, the overall trend remains positive, suggesting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite news-driven volatility, Dogecoin lacks strong technical or fundamental support for a directional move, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of risk-on behavior, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is advisable, despite recent minting activity indicating demand for liquidity."
2024-11-20 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by favorable news, including ETF optimism and institutional interest. Ethereum is experiencing a moderate upward trend, buoyed by breaking the $3,000 mark and positive ETF developments. Solana is also seeing positive sentiment with ETF filings and bullish price predictions. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to speculative trading and political news, while Tether remains stable with increased minting activity suggesting anticipated demand. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility and stable conditions, with no significant shifts in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. Technical indicators are bullish, suggesting continued positive movement.

ETH: +0.3 — Recent price increase and positive ETF news provide a moderate bullish outlook, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF filings and bullish price predictions, although technical indicators are not yet fully supportive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative interest and political news, the technical indicators do not suggest a strong directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-11-20 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward momentum, bolstered by pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals' treasury allocation. Ethereum has broken through the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a move towards $3,800. Solana is also showing bullish signs, with ETF filings and optimistic price targets suggesting further upside. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political speculation, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news regarding institutional adoption and political support make it a highly attractive asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite lacking a buy signal from technical indicators, Ethereum's recent price surge and potential for further gains justify a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bullish news and ETF filing, coupled with positive price action, suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin's price is volatile, the political attention and speculative interest provide a slight positive bias, though caution is advised.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing a risk-on sentiment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-20 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $95K due to positive news from Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, while Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment with ETF filings and predictions of a significant price increase. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to political developments, although its technical indicators remain neutral. Meanwhile, USDT is experiencing increased minting, possibly in anticipation of heightened market demand. The macroeconomic context shows relatively stable conditions, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could influence crypto market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum supported by positive news and technical indicators. The ETF optimism and institutional interest further bolster its attractiveness.

**ETH: +0.3** — Ethereum's recent price surge past $3,000 and potential for further gains make it a moderately attractive asset, although technical indicators are currently neutral.

**SOL: +0.5** — Solana's bullish sentiment, driven by ETF filings and price predictions, suggests potential for upward movement, making it an appealing asset to allocate more capital.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Despite speculative interest due to political news, Dogecoin's technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a hold position for now.

**USDT: -0.3** — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, there is less need to hold USDT, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure."
2024-11-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark, driven by positive news surrounding potential regulatory reforms and stablecoin inflows. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana continues to attract attention with record highs and potential ETF developments, signaling robust investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin is experiencing a surge in interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, stablecoins like USDT are seeing increased demand, although there is a growing trend towards regulated alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news and increased on-chain activity, suggesting continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, strong ETF inflows and regaining USDT dominance indicate a positive outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record highs and potential ETF developments suggest strong investor interest and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive news and whale accumulation provide a supportive backdrop, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — While stablecoin demand remains high, the overall market's bullish sentiment suggests a slight rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-11-21 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark, driven by regulatory optimism and substantial stablecoin inflows, indicating growing demand. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, highlighted by significant ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana continues to attract attention with record highs and potential ETF developments, suggesting increasing institutional focus. Dogecoin is buoyed by high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, although its technical indicators remain neutral. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The potential for regulatory reforms adds to the bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest through ETF inflows and USDT dominance on Ethereum provide a supportive backdrop, although technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and ETF interest indicate strong investor enthusiasm, supported by bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though technicals are neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, USDT is less attractive in the current market environment."
2024-11-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-21 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark due to optimism around potential regulatory reforms and stablecoin inflows indicating increased demand for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana's record high and the filing of a Solana ETF highlight growing institutional focus. Dogecoin has seen increased attention with high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though its technical indicators remain mixed. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with bullish technical signals and positive news about regulatory optimism and stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding Tether supply dominance and ETF inflows support a moderate bullish stance, despite mixed technical signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Record high prices and institutional interest through ETF filings indicate strong momentum and investor enthusiasm, justifying a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite mixed technicals, high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a supportive backdrop for potential gains, warranting a cautious positive stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, maintaining lower exposure to stablecoins is advisable in the current market environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and record stablecoin inflows, indicating strong demand. Ethereum is experiencing increased institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana continues to attract investor enthusiasm, reaching record highs and drawing attention from institutional players with potential ETF filings. Dogecoin is gaining momentum due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is seeing a shift in dominance back to Ethereum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with significant price increases and positive news on regulatory optimism and stablecoin inflows. The market is showing robust demand for Bitcoin, making it an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest is high, as indicated by ETF inflows and its regained position in Tether issuance. While technical indicators are mixed, the news supports a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and institutional interest through ETF filings suggest continued upward momentum. The positive sentiment and technical signals support a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a supportive backdrop for potential gains, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital flowing into other cryptocurrencies, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive. A reduction in USDT allocation is advised to capitalize on bullish market conditions."
2024-11-21 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic indicators and significant developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and record stablecoin inflows, indicating strong demand. Ethereum is seeing substantial institutional interest with significant ETF inflows and regaining its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana is experiencing heightened investor enthusiasm, reaching record highs and attracting institutional attention with a potential ETF. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. In contrast, Tether remains stable, with some shifts in its blockchain dominance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and record stablecoin inflows. The potential for regulatory reforms adds to the bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and ETF inflows indicate strong market confidence, despite neutral technical signals.

SOL: +0.7 — Record highs and potential ETF developments highlight strong investor enthusiasm and institutional focus.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though technicals remain mixed.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, USDT demand may decrease in the short term."
2024-11-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating strong demand. Ethereum is also seeing positive institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows. Solana has hit a record high, supported by growing adoption and institutional focus. Dogecoin is experiencing renewed interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with Ethereum regaining its dominance as the leading blockchain for USDT issuance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, including regulatory optimism and stablecoin inflows, support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest through ETF inflows and reclaiming USDT dominance suggest a positive trend, though not as strong as BTC.

SOL: +0.7 — Record highs and institutional interest through ETF filings indicate strong bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, but less momentum compared to other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — While stablecoin inflows are high, the current market conditions favor risk assets, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT."
2024-11-21 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and strong stablecoin inflows. Ethereum is witnessing significant institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana is experiencing strong momentum, reaching record highs and attracting institutional attention with a new ETF filing. Dogecoin is gaining traction due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and no major shifts in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news on regulatory optimism and record stablecoin inflows, suggests a favorable environment for further gains.

**ETH: +0.6** — Ethereum's strong institutional interest and reclaiming dominance in USDT supply indicate robust demand, warranting increased allocation.

**SOL: +0.5** — Solana's record high and institutional focus through ETF filings highlight its growth potential, justifying a positive allocation signal.

**DOGE: +0.3** — While Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, its speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach compared to other assets.

**USDT: -0.5** — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT aligns with the current bullish market sentiment."
2024-11-21 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows indicating heightened demand. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana has reached new highs, buoyed by rising adoption and the prospect of a Solana ETF, while Dogecoin is seeing increased interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant bullish signals, as investors seem to be rotating capital into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued demand and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and regained USDT dominance provide a solid foundation for growth, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.5 — Record highs and potential ETF developments indicate strong market enthusiasm and potential for continued upward movement.

DOGE: +0.3 — High-profile endorsements and whale accumulation create a positive sentiment, though the technicals are less compelling.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral with no significant signals to increase or decrease exposure, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility."
2024-11-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark due to optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand for crypto assets. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana continues to attract attention with record highs and the prospect of a new ETF, while Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Despite these positive developments, USDT remains stable, with no significant buy signals, suggesting a shift in capital towards more volatile assets as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by both technical indicators and positive news, such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and record stablecoin inflows, suggest continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and reclaiming USDT dominance provide a bullish outlook, although the price has shown minor fluctuations.

SOL: +0.5 — Record highs and the potential for a new ETF highlight strong investor enthusiasm, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — High-profile endorsements and whale accumulation create a positive sentiment, though it remains a more speculative play compared to other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite its stability, the lack of bullish signals and the shift in capital towards riskier assets suggest maintaining a neutral position."
2024-11-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand for crypto assets. Ethereum has seen significant institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana has reached new all-time highs, supported by growing adoption and investor enthusiasm, alongside news of a potential Solana ETF. Dogecoin has experienced increased attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but less attractive as capital rotates into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news sentiment, including potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.9 — Significant institutional interest and positive technical indicators, along with Ethereum's regained dominance in USDT supply, indicate strong bullish sentiment.

SOL: +0.7 — Record highs and institutional interest, as evidenced by the potential Solana ETF, support a positive outlook for further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment driven by high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation, although the meme coin nature suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in allocation preference, with capital rotation favoring riskier assets in the current bullish environment."
2024-11-21 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing a significant psychological milestone of $100K, fueled by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increasing stablecoin inflows, which indicate growing demand. Ethereum is experiencing robust institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and regaining dominance in USDT supply. Solana is also gaining traction with record highs and institutional interest in ETFs, while Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. In contrast, USDT remains stable but lacks bullish signals, suggesting a capital rotation towards more volatile assets as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong momentum, supported by positive news and increasing stablecoin inflows, suggests continued upward movement. The potential for regulatory reforms adds to the bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's significant price increase, coupled with strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, indicates a robust bullish trend. The reclaiming of USDT supply dominance further strengthens its position.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high and the filing for a Solana ETF highlight growing institutional interest and adoption, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation, indicating potential for further gains despite its meme coin status.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in the current environment, with capital likely rotating into more volatile assets amid increasing risk appetite."
2024-11-21 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

In contrast, Tether remains stable, with no major bullish signals, as capital appears to be rotating into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news regarding regulatory reforms and increasing stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest is high, as shown by substantial ETF inflows and regained USDT dominance, suggesting a favorable environment for Ethereum's growth.

SOL: +0.5 — Record high prices and institutional interest, highlighted by the Bitwise ETF filing, suggest continued bullish momentum and adoption.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation, although the price movement is less pronounced compared to other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin remains neutral as capital rotates into more volatile assets, with no significant bullish signals to warrant increased exposure."
2024-11-21 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increasing demand indicated by record stablecoin inflows. Ethereum has regained its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance, with substantial institutional interest reflected in ETF inflows. Solana is experiencing a surge, reaching an all-time high, driven by growing adoption and institutional focus, as evidenced by the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, suggesting increased confidence in the asset. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant buy signals, as risk appetite appears to be shifting towards more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum is supported by positive news and increasing demand, as indicated by stablecoin inflows. The potential for regulatory reforms further boosts sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest is high, with significant ETF inflows and regained dominance in USDT supply. The technical indicators also support a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.9 — Record highs and strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the Solana ETF filing, indicate robust demand. The technical breakout supports a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation suggests potential for upward movement, although the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT serves as a safe haven, but current market conditions favor riskier assets. No significant buy or sell signals are present."
2024-11-21 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive news and strong technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and substantial stablecoin inflows, which signal increased demand. Ethereum is seeing significant institutional interest, with large ETF inflows and regaining its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana has reached a record high, supported by growing adoption and institutional focus, as evidenced by the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is experiencing renewed interest due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is seeing competition from new regulated stablecoin alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating robust demand and potential for further price increases.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and positive news about USDT dominance on Ethereum provide a strong bullish case, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.7 — Record high prices and the potential for an ETF suggest continued upward momentum and strong investor interest.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though the meme coin's volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While stablecoin inflows are high, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation."
2024-11-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana has reached a record high, spurred by growing adoption and the filing of a Solana ETF by Bitwise. Dogecoin is experiencing renewed interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant adverse indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news regarding regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, which suggest increased demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest and regained dominance in USDT supply, indicating robust market confidence and potential for continued growth.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's record high and the filing for a Solana ETF highlight strong investor enthusiasm and institutional focus, suggesting further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's fundamentals are less compelling, high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a moderate bullish signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent to allow for potential capital rotation into more promising assets."
2024-11-21 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana has reached a record high, supported by growing adoption and the prospect of a Solana ETF, which highlights rising institutional focus. Dogecoin is benefiting from high-profile endorsements and significant accumulation by whales, while Tether remains stable with its dominance on the Ethereum blockchain reaffirmed.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum is supported by positive news on regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating robust demand.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest is high, with strong ETF inflows and regained USDT dominance, suggesting a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Record high prices and the potential for a Solana ETF indicate strong investor enthusiasm and institutional interest.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation supports a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — While stablecoin inflows are high, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining current exposure without further allocation."
2024-11-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic indicators and strong news developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, boosted by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and record stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance, and significant inflows into Ethereum ETFs suggest strong institutional interest. Solana has reached an all-time high, supported by growing adoption and the potential for a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is experiencing increased interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. In contrast, USDT remains stable but is seeing competition from new regulated stablecoin alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by news of potential regulatory reforms and record stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand and optimism.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from reclaiming USDT dominance and significant ETF inflows, suggesting strong institutional interest and potential for further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.7 — Reaching an all-time high and potential ETF developments signal strong investor enthusiasm and adoption, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: +0.4 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though the meme coin nature warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While stablecoin inflows are high, the overall bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation."
2024-11-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with several cryptocurrencies reaching new all-time highs or showing strong upward momentum. Bitcoin has surged close to the $100,000 mark, driven by significant institutional inflows and optimism post-U.S. elections. Ethereum is also experiencing a strong rally, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although recent whale sell-offs have introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing significance in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculative news regarding potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's proximity to an all-time high and strong institutional inflows suggest continued upward momentum, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains indicate a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest from potential integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive, though some liquidity is still necessary."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and positive ETF news. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a significant whale sell-off, but it has shown strong momentum with a recent breakout. Solana has reached a new all-time high and is gaining prominence in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume. Dogecoin has seen a significant price jump due to speculation around Elon Musk's potential integration of DOGE into X's payment system. Tether has been actively minting USDT, coinciding with Bitcoin's rally, indicating increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are driving it towards a new all-time high, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-off volatility, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive momentum signal a potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its growing role in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, indicate strong investor confidence and potential for continued growth.

DOGE: +0.4 — Speculation around Elon Musk's potential integration of DOGE into X's payment system has spurred significant interest, suggesting short-term upside potential.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, holding USDT is less attractive, warranting a reduction in exposure."
2024-11-22 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news. Ethereum is also experiencing significant gains, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although some volatility is introduced by large whale sell-offs. Solana continues to show strength, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin's price has been positively influenced by speculation around its integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, although its momentum appears less stable. Tether's recent minting activity aligns with the broader market rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and ETF news support continued upward momentum. On-chain activity is robust, indicating sustained interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant price gains suggest a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — New all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight Solana's growing prominence and investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system, but less stable compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-11-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark due to strong institutional inflows and significant ETF investments. Ethereum is also experiencing a positive trend, breaking out of a long downtrend despite some volatility from large whale sell-offs. Solana has reached new all-time highs and is gaining traction in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume. Dogecoin has seen a price increase driven by speculation of integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether continues to mint significant amounts of USDT, aligning with the broader crypto market rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional support and ETF inflows are driving its price to new highs, suggesting continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and recent gains indicate a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing importance in the crypto ecosystem.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and ecosystem expansion supports a moderate buy signal.

2024-11-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows into Bitcoin, which has reached a new all-time high near $100,000. This optimism is further supported by the launch of Bitcoin ETFs attracting substantial capital. Ethereum is also experiencing positive momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend despite some volatility from large sell-offs. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing role in the DeFi space. Dogecoin's price has been buoyed by speculation around its potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests preparation for increased trading volumes amid the Bitcoin rally.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and strategic acquisitions support a modest bullish outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's minting activity is notable, the overall bullish market sentiment reduces the immediate need for stablecoin exposure."
2024-11-22 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high near $100,000, driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF-related optimism. Ethereum is also showing positive momentum, breaking out of a downtrend despite some volatility from large sell-offs. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, reflecting its growing prominence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has experienced a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market's upward trend.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional support and ETF inflows are driving its price to new highs, indicating continued upward momentum. The macroeconomic context remains favorable for BTC as a hedge against inflation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news support a moderately bullish outlook. Its recent gains and potential for a new all-time high make it attractive.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing importance in the crypto ecosystem, suggesting further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration into Elon Musk's X payment system and recent acquisitions are boosting sentiment, though the speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing strong bullish sentiment, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for holding USDT."
2024-11-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional inflows and positive news, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100,000, supported by significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Ethereum has shown resilience with a breakout from a prolonged downtrend, though recent whale sell-offs have introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume and reaching new all-time highs. Dogecoin has experienced a price spike due to speculation around its integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader crypto rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and new all-time high, coupled with ETF support, suggest continued upward momentum. The macroeconomic context is also favorable, with low volatility and a stable S&P 500.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news support a moderately bullish outlook. However, the lack of strong momentum signals tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased prominence in DeFi, along with bullish momentum signals, make it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system provides a positive sentiment boost, though technical indicators remain mixed.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital flowing into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 milestone and strong institutional inflows, as well as positive developments in Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted significant capital, further supporting BTC's upward trajectory. Ethereum has shown strong momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend despite some volatility from large sell-offs. Solana's recent all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing role in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around its potential integration into Elon Musk's payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's substantial minting activity aligns with the broader crypto rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are driving BTC towards a new all-time high, indicating robust bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains suggest a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume indicate strong investor confidence and growing utility.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration with Elon Musk's payment system and recent acquisitions support a moderately bullish stance.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the overall bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as capital rotates into riskier assets."
2024-11-22 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news. Ethereum also shows positive momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although recent whale activity has introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong investor confidence and growing prominence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has experienced a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's payment system, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests increased demand for liquidity amid the Bitcoin rally.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence and investor confidence, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration into Elon Musk's payment system and recent portfolio acquisitions provide a bullish sentiment, though with moderate confidence.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-22 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high near $100K and strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing positive momentum, with Ethereum breaking out of a prolonged downtrend and Solana achieving a new all-time high, bolstered by its growing DeFi presence. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculative news related to potential integration with Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market rally. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging capital allocation into cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, new all-time high, and significant ETF inflows suggest continued bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic environment also supports further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high make it attractive, though slightly less so than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest from potential integration with X's payment system and strategic acquisitions support a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing a risk-on sentiment and cryptocurrencies rallying, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-11-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark due to strong institutional inflows and ETF-related optimism. Ethereum is showing mixed signals; despite a recent whale sell-off, it has broken out of a prolonged downtrend, indicating potential for further gains. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, highlighting its growing influence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative news around potential integration into Elon Musk's payment systems, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests increased demand for liquidity amid the market rally.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and leadership in DEX trading volume underscore its growing market strength and investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest from Elon Musk-related news provides a mild bullish sentiment, though fundamentals remain unchanged.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is less need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a shift towards more volatile assets."
2024-11-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, nearing the $100K mark, supported by ETF inflows and post-election optimism. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off, but it has also shown strong momentum with a recent breakout. Solana has hit a new all-time high and is gaining prominence in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around its integration into X's payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's rally, indicating a potential increase in liquidity and market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows, ETF support, and a new all-time high indicate robust bullish sentiment. The recent price surge and positive news suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-off volatility, Ethereum's breakout and momentum suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. However, the whale sell-off introduces some risk.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing strength and investor confidence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and portfolio acquisition news provide a mild bullish outlook, though speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment is bullish and risk appetite increases, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT, reducing the need for holding it in the portfolio."
2024-11-22 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies reaching or approaching new all-time highs. Bitcoin has been bolstered by strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news, pushing its price close to the $100,000 mark. Ethereum has shown significant upward momentum, despite some volatility from large whale sell-offs. Solana continues to gain traction, surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume and hitting new all-time highs, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin has experienced a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's increased minting activity suggests a supportive backdrop for liquidity amid the broader crypto rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's approach to a new all-time high, combined with strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news, indicates robust upward momentum. The macro environment and market sentiment are supportive of further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs introducing volatility, Ethereum's break from a long downtrend and positive news suggest potential for continued growth, though with some caution due to recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its increasing prominence in DeFi, surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume, highlight its growing attractiveness and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculative news, the lack of sustained technical signals and broader market catalysts suggests a more cautious approach, though the sentiment remains slightly positive.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies and capital rotating into riskier assets, maintaining high exposure to stablecoins like USDT is less attractive. The increased minting of USDT may provide liquidity but suggests a shift towards risk assets."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news surrounding Bitcoin, which has reached a new all-time high near $100,000. This optimism is further supported by the substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off, but it has shown strong momentum with a recent breakout from a downtrend. Solana has hit a new all-time high, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong investor confidence and growing prominence in the DeFi space.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong institutional inflows provide a robust bullish signal. The ETF-related news further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing strength and investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing strong bullish signals, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets with higher upside potential."
2024-11-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 milestone and strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum has shown significant price gains, although recent whale activity has introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain prominence, marked by a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in interest due to potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader crypto market rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news provide a robust bullish backdrop, with potential for further gains as it nears $100,000.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains suggest positive momentum, though with some caution due to volatility.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing strength and investor confidence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and strategic acquisitions in the DOGE ecosystem provide a mild positive outlook, though less compelling than other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the overall bullish market conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a liquidity buffer without immediate need for reduction."
2024-11-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin's recent all-time high nearing $100K and significant institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off, but it has shown strong momentum with a recent breakout. Solana has reached a new all-time high and is gaining prominence in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation about potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's rally, indicating a robust demand for liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are highly supportive, indicating continued upward momentum and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout and momentum suggest a positive outlook, though with some caution due to recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and ecosystem expansion supports a modest positive outlook, though the recent price decrease warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across other assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-22 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a strong bullish sentiment, particularly for Bitcoin, which has reached a new all-time high near $100,000. This surge is supported by significant institutional inflows and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted substantial investment. Ethereum is also experiencing positive momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although recent whale activity has introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation about potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether's minting activity aligns with the broader market rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news provide a robust bullish outlook, supported by its new all-time high.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence in the DeFi space, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a modestly positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's minting activity is notable, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation to stablecoins."
2024-11-22 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and strong institutional inflows, alongside significant ETF investments. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to large whale sell-offs, but it has broken out of a prolonged downtrend, suggesting potential for further gains. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong growth in the DeFi space. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative news regarding potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, leading to a price surge. Meanwhile, Tether's substantial minting activity aligns with the broader bullish trend, supporting liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and nearing an all-time high, suggests continued bullish potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-offs by whales, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high justify a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and increased ecosystem utility support a bullish stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's bullish sentiment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT in favor of riskier assets."
2024-11-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100,000, supported by significant ETF inflows, which indicates strong institutional interest. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to whale activity but has shown a strong breakout from a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing role in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, which has bolstered its market sentiment. Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and new all-time high indicate continued bullish momentum. The ETF-related news further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive price action suggest moderate upside potential.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its increasing prominence and investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and ecosystem expansion news provide a slight positive bias.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT minting is high, the current market environment favors risk assets over stablecoins, suggesting a hold position."
2024-11-22 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, nearing the $100,000 mark, supported by strong ETF inflows and optimism post-U.S. elections. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off but has shown strong momentum with a recent breakout from a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing influence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative news about potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, boosting its price. Meanwhile, Tether is actively minting USDT to meet increasing demand, aligning with Bitcoin's rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price to new highs, suggesting continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive momentum justify a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and its growing prominence in DeFi support a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Speculative interest from potential integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions suggest a favorable environment for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish sentiment, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for holding USDT."
2024-11-23 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows reduced trading activity with a drop in open interest, suggesting potential short-term consolidation. Solana continues its bullish trend, reaching an all-time high with expectations for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, with technicals suggesting potential for further upside. Tether has increased its supply significantly, indicating strong demand for liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K make BTC highly attractive. The overall bullish market environment supports increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite facing resistance and reduced trading activity, ETH remains stable. The lack of clear bullish signals warrants a neutral stance for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching an all-time high and positive analyst projections suggest further upside potential. Strong demand and adoption trends support a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge and technical indicators pointing to potential further gains make DOGE attractive, though with some caution due to its volatile nature.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on bullish market conditions."
2024-11-23 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and positive sentiment about its potential to surpass $100K by year-end. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains, indicating strong demand and bullish momentum. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting a potential rally to $0.82. Ethereum, however, is facing resistance at $3.4K, with a decline in futures open interest indicating reduced trading activity. Tether has increased its issuance to meet rising market demand, reflecting a need for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment about reaching $100K. The buy signals from trend indicators and news support further allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Facing resistance at $3.4K with declining open interest, indicating potential short-term pullback. The lack of bullish signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — All-time high and bullish projections with strong demand and rising adoption. Despite no buy signals in technicals, the positive news and market sentiment justify increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum with potential for further rally. The breakout above the upper Bollinger Band supports a positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite increased issuance, the overall bullish sentiment in other assets suggests maintaining current exposure to USDT, as risk appetite increases."
2024-11-23 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF inflows and optimistic year-end projections. Ethereum, however, faces resistance at $3.4K, with declining open interest suggesting reduced trading activity. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets due to increased adoption. Dogecoin is experiencing a surge in interest, with technicals indicating potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet market demand, reflecting a stable environment for USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K make BTC highly attractive.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a slight upward price movement, resistance at $3.4K and declining open interest suggest a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Reaching an all-time high and positive analyst projections support a moderately bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.3 — With the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-11-23 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana, driven by strong demand and positive news. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by significant ETF inflows, and analysts are optimistic about its potential to surpass this milestone by year-end. Solana has hit an all-time high, with projections of further gains due to rising adoption and positive technical indicators. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge, with predictions of further upward movement if momentum sustains. Ethereum, however, faces resistance and reduced trading activity, indicating potential short-term consolidation. Tether's recent minting suggests increased liquidity demand, but the broader market's risk-on sentiment may reduce the need for stablecoin holdings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive ETF-related news support further gains. The market is optimistic about reaching $100K soon.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum's technical indicators are turning positive, suggesting potential for a breakout if market conditions improve.

SOL: +0.7 — All-time high and bullish momentum, with analysts raising price targets. Strong demand and adoption support further capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge and technical breakout potential. Continued interest in memecoins could drive further gains.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite increased minting, the current risk-on market environment suggests maintaining a neutral stance on stablecoins."
2024-11-23 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana, driven by strong demand and positive news. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark due to significant ETF inflows and optimistic market sentiment, suggesting a high probability of further gains. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further price increases due to rising adoption. Dogecoin is experiencing a surge in interest, with technical indicators suggesting potential for continued upward movement. Ethereum, however, faces resistance and reduced trading activity, indicating potential short-term challenges. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with a relatively low volatility index and a strong U.S. dollar, which may influence risk appetite and capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish signals, resistance at $3.4K and reduced open interest suggest caution, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and bullish projections support further gains, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge and potential for further breakout justify a positive allocation signal.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-23 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment, indicating a potential breakthrough. Ethereum faces resistance at $3.4K, with declining open interest suggesting a possible short-term pullback. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets due to strong demand and bullish momentum. Dogecoin has experienced a substantial surge, with technicals indicating a potential rally continuation. Tether has increased its supply to meet rising market demand, reflecting a stable yet cautious market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF inflows and positive sentiment, with a high probability of surpassing $100K, makes BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance and reduced trading activity, ETH still has a bullish trend, but with less immediate upside compared to BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and raised price targets suggest continued bullish momentum, making SOL a favorable asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Recent price surge and potential for further gains support a positive outlook, though with higher volatility compared to other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT remains neutral as a stablecoin, serving as a potential hedge but not a priority for capital allocation in a bullish market."
2024-11-23 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and strong market sentiment predicting further price increases. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of a potential short-term pullback due to reduced trading activity. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains amid rising adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a notable surge, driven by renewed interest in memecoins and technical indicators suggesting further upside potential. Tether has increased its supply significantly to meet rising demand, indicating a robust liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment suggest a continued upward trajectory, making BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $3.4K, the overall bullish market environment supports a modest positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to reduced trading activity.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and bullish momentum, coupled with positive analyst projections, make Solana an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price surge and technical indicators pointing to further gains support a positive allocation, though the inherent volatility of memecoins suggests a balanced approach.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, given the overall bullish sentiment across other assets."
2024-11-23 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana, driven by significant ETF inflows for BTC and Solana reaching new all-time highs. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, with strong institutional interest suggesting further upside potential. Solana's momentum is supported by rising adoption and bullish price targets. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of reduced trading activity, indicating a potential short-term pullback. Dogecoin has experienced a notable surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting further upside. Tether's recent minting of USDT indicates strong demand for liquidity, although its role as a stablecoin limits its upside in a bullish market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and bullish sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K. Despite current technicals, the macro environment supports further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Facing resistance at $3.4K and declining open interest suggest a potential short-term pullback. Neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Reached an all-time high with strong bullish momentum and positive price targets. Continued adoption and demand support further upside.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent surge and potential for further gains due to memecoin interest and technical indicators. However, volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-11-23 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana, as both assets are experiencing significant upward momentum. Bitcoin is nearing the psychological $100K mark, fueled by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, with analysts predicting a strong likelihood of surpassing this level by year-end. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets due to increasing adoption and demand. Ethereum, however, faces resistance and a decline in futures open interest, indicating potential short-term challenges. Dogecoin has seen a significant price jump due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting further potential gains. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet rising demand, indicating a robust liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with ETF inflows and positive sentiment suggesting a potential breakthrough of the $100K mark. The macroeconomic context supports risk-on assets, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance at $3.4K and a decline in open interest, the overall bullish market sentiment and its role as a major crypto asset justify a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching an all-time high with bullish momentum and increased adoption, Solana is well-positioned for further gains, supported by analyst upgrades.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further rally to $0.82 make Dogecoin attractive, although its volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish market environment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-23 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing some resistance at $3,400, still shows bullish momentum, although reduced trading activity is noted. Solana has hit an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains, indicating strong demand and adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge, driven by renewed interest and high volume, with potential for further rallying. Tether has increased its supply significantly, indicating high demand for liquidity, but this also suggests a cautious approach as some investors may seek stability amidst volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF-related news and bullish sentiment with a high likelihood of surpassing $100K. Despite technical indicators not showing a buy signal, the macroeconomic context and news support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Although facing resistance at $3,400, the overall bullish momentum and potential for a breakout justify a moderate positive allocation. The drop in open interest suggests caution, but the price momentum remains supportive.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching an all-time high and with a raised price target, Solana shows strong bullish momentum and adoption, warranting a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price surge and technicals suggesting further rally potential make Dogecoin attractive, though its volatility requires careful monitoring.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets. However, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent for liquidity needs."
2024-11-23 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of reduced trading activity, which may indicate a short-term pullback. Solana continues to show strength, reaching an all-time high and with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price surge due to renewed interest, with technical indicators suggesting potential for further rally. Tether has increased its supply significantly to meet rising demand, indicating a healthy liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF inflows and positive sentiment towards reaching $100K. The macroeconomic context is supportive of risk assets, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's potential for a breakout and its current bullish momentum suggest a modest positive allocation, though caution is warranted due to reduced trading activity.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's recent all-time high and positive analyst projections support a bullish outlook. Strong demand and adoption trends make it a favorable asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and technical indicators pointing to further gains justify a positive allocation, though the memecoin's volatility suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current bullish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a liquidity buffer in a potentially volatile market."
2024-11-23 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, with a noted decrease in futures open interest, suggesting possible short-term consolidation. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains driven by rising adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price surge, fueled by renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting potential for further growth. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting new USDT to meet market demand, indicating strong liquidity needs.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $3.4K, the overall bullish market environment supports a moderate positive allocation, though caution is advised due to reduced trading activity.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching an all-time high with bullish momentum and a raised price target suggests continued upward potential, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and potential for further rallying due to technical indicators support a positive allocation, though volatility should be monitored.

USDT: -0.5 — With strong bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-23 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, suggesting a potential breakthrough. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of a possible short-term pullback due to reduced trading activity. Solana continues to demonstrate bullish momentum, reaching an all-time high and attracting positive analyst projections. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, though recent price volatility suggests caution. Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for liquidity, reflecting a balanced risk appetite in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment indicate potential for continued upward momentum, making BTC a favorable asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance and reduced open interest, ETH's bullish momentum and proximity to key resistance suggest cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching an all-time high and positive analyst outlook support further gains, making SOL an attractive asset for increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price surge and potential for further breakout warrant a slight positive bias, though volatility suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, favoring allocation to more volatile assets."
2024-11-23 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is nearing the significant psychological level of $100K, driven by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, indicating potential for further gains. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, with decreasing open interest suggesting a possible short-term pullback. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains, supported by strong demand and bullish momentum. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge, driven by renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting potential for further rally. Tether has increased its supply significantly, indicating strong demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum fueled by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, with a high probability of surpassing $100K soon.

ETH: +0.1 — Although facing resistance, the overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market supports a slightly positive outlook, but caution is warranted due to reduced open interest.

SOL: +0.6 — All-time high and strong bullish momentum, with analysts projecting further gains, makes Solana an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent surge and potential for further rally due to technical indicators, but the inherent volatility of memecoins suggests a moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for holding USDT in the current market conditions."
2024-11-23 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, with reduced trading activity suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana continues to show bullish momentum, having recently hit an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge driven by renewed interest, although technical indicators suggest potential for further growth if momentum sustains. Tether has been actively minting new USDT to meet rising demand, indicating a robust appetite for liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment suggest further upside potential. The likelihood of surpassing $100K by year-end is high, making BTC a favorable asset to increase exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, ETH faces resistance at $3.4K and reduced trading activity. This mixed sentiment warrants a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and bullish projections support a positive outlook. Continued adoption and strong demand make SOL attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further gains suggest a moderate increase in exposure, although caution is advised due to its volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With rising risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-23 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the psychological $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Ethereum faces resistance at $3.4K, with reduced open interest suggesting a potential short-term pullback.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment with a high likelihood of surpassing $100K by year-end support a bullish outlook, despite recent technical weakness.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance at $3.4K, the overall market sentiment remains positive, and the reduced open interest could lead to a rebound if broader market conditions improve.

SOL: +0.6 — With an all-time high and bullish analyst projections, Solana remains attractive, benefiting from strong demand and rising adoption.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, the potential for a breakout to $0.82 and high trading volume suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is warranted."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and a strong market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows mixed signals with reduced open interest. Solana continues to exhibit bullish momentum, reaching all-time highs and with analysts projecting further price increases. Dogecoin's recent surge indicates renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting potential for further gains. Tether has increased its supply significantly, indicating a demand for liquidity, which could suggest some market participants are preparing for volatility or taking profits.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment suggest further upside potential, despite technical signals indicating a possible short-term pullback.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance and reduced open interest, the overall market momentum and potential for a breakout above $3.4K provide a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued bullish momentum and strong demand, coupled with a raised price target, support further capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and technical predictions of further gains make DOGE attractive, though it remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased market optimism and capital rotation into riskier assets, holding USDT is less attractive, especially with no current holdings."
2024-11-23 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, especially for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K milestone, driven by significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3,400, shows some signs of reduced trading activity, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana continues its bullish trend, having reached an all-time high with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price surge due to renewed interest and high volume, with technicals indicating the potential for further upward movement. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting new USDT to meet rising demand, indicating a robust liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment about reaching $100K suggest continued upward momentum, making BTC a favorable asset to allocate more capital to.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance and reduced trading activity, the overall market sentiment remains positive, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — With SOL reaching an all-time high and analysts projecting further gains, it presents a strong case for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — The recent surge and potential for further gains make DOGE an attractive option for capital allocation, though with some caution due to its volatile nature.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-11-23 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum faces resistance at $3.4K, with a notable drop in futures open interest indicating reduced trading activity. Solana continues to show strong bullish momentum, reaching an all-time high and with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting potential for further rally. Tether has increased its supply significantly to meet rising market demand, indicating a healthy appetite for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. The potential for BTC to surpass $100K by year-end adds to its attractiveness.

ETH: 0.0 — While ETH faces resistance at $3.4K, the drop in futures open interest suggests caution. The mixed technical signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and recent all-time high, coupled with positive analyst projections, make SOL an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further rally due to renewed interest in memecoins suggest a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased market demand for risk assets and significant minting activity, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-11-23 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive sentiment for reaching $100K, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with resistance at $3,400 and decreased futures interest suggest holding current positions without additional allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and bullish projections support increased allocation, reflecting strong demand and positive sentiment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further gains warrant a modest increase in allocation, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate."

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin nearing the $100K milestone, though it has faced some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance, with significant staking inflows and a 40% increase in November, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, despite recent volatility, has seen a surge in derivatives demand, indicating speculative interest. Tether continues to provide liquidity to the market with substantial new issuances, supporting overall market stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While Bitcoin's rally has stalled near $100K, the overall sentiment remains positive, with strong on-chain activity and market interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's strong performance in November and increased staking activity suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels indicate potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility, the surge in open interest suggests speculative interest, but no strong directional signal is present.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing signs of cautious optimism, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-24 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, reflecting investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin experienced volatility with a significant drop, yet speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuance, highlighting its role in maintaining liquidity amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While BTC's rally has stalled, the proximity to the $100K mark and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, albeit with caution due to profit-taking.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong performance in November and increased staking inflows indicate robust investor confidence and reduced supply, making ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for upward movement, supported by market forecasts targeting higher prices.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop warrant caution, though high speculative interest could lead to quick rebounds.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite increased issuance supporting liquidity, the current market environment does not strongly favor holding or reducing stablecoin exposure."
2024-11-24 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum continues to show strength with significant staking inflows and a notable price increase in November, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, defending key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced increased volatility with a recent price drop, although speculative interest remains high. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance continues to support market liquidity, with significant new minting and potential large-scale BTC loan ventures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and bullish momentum signal suggests a moderate buy, though caution is warranted due to market hesitation.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, supporting a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further gains, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price drop and volatility, combined with speculative interest, suggest caution. However, since we hold DOGE, a slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stable market conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as it serves as a liquidity buffer."
2024-11-24 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, though cautious profit-taking is noted.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum from staking inflows and significant November gains make Ethereum an attractive asset, with technical indicators supporting continued growth.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and technical support at key levels indicate potential for further gains, making Solana a favorable asset in the current market.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and a price drop suggest caution, though high speculative interest could lead to future opportunities. Current holdings warrant a slight reduction.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral. While market liquidity is supported by new issuances, no significant shift in risk appetite is observed to warrant a change in allocation."
2024-11-24 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment shows a mix of cautious optimism and profit-taking. Bitcoin's recent approach towards the $100,000 mark indicates strong bullish sentiment, although the rally has temporarily stalled as traders reassess their positions. Ethereum has shown significant strength with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced a sharp decline, reflecting high volatility and speculative interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in providing market liquidity, with substantial new issuances supporting trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100,000 mark and the bullish sentiment in the news suggest potential for further gains. However, caution is warranted due to profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's strong performance in November and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and the ongoing bullish sentiment suggest potential for further upward movement, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — The recent sharp decline and high volatility indicate a need to reduce exposure, as speculative interest may lead to further instability.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT remains neutral. The stablecoin's role in maintaining liquidity is important, but there is no immediate signal to allocate capital here given the current risk appetite."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana is maintaining bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced volatility with a significant drop, although speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with substantial new issuance, and potential developments in Bitcoin-backed loans could impact market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100,000 and bullish momentum signals suggest potential for further gains. However, market hesitation warrants a moderate score.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and technical support at $240, with potential for a breakout, make Solana attractive, though not as strong as Ethereum.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop suggest caution, although high speculative interest could lead to future opportunities.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stablecoin issuance supporting liquidity, maintaining a neutral stance while monitoring market developments."
2024-11-24 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and reassessment by traders. Ethereum has shown significant strength with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, with key support levels holding and potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced volatility with a recent drop, although speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to provide liquidity to the market with significant new issuance, indicating robust demand for stablecoins as a liquidity tool.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and nearing of the $100K mark suggest continued potential for gains, supported by strong on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong performance in November and increased staking activity indicate a positive outlook, with potential for further appreciation as investor confidence grows.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's defense of key support levels and bullish sentiment suggest potential for continued upward movement, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite high speculative interest, recent volatility and a lack of strong bullish signals suggest a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-11-24 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 threshold before experiencing a pullback, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong performance with a 40% increase in November, bolstered by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, defending key support levels and eyeing further gains. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline, with increased volatility and speculative interest. Tether's issuance has increased significantly, enhancing market liquidity, which may indicate a readiness for further market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100,000 mark and bullish momentum signals suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong performance in November and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further price appreciation, though recent momentum signals are mixed.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price drop and high volatility, coupled with speculative interest, suggest caution and a potential reduction in exposure to manage risk.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate as market conditions do not strongly favor stablecoin allocation at this time."
2024-11-24 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance, with significant staking inflows and a 40% increase in value for November, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced a significant drop in price, despite high speculative interest, indicating volatility and uncertainty. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance and potential for large-scale Bitcoin-backed loans.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and on-chain activity support a moderately positive outlook. Profit-taking is a concern, but the overall trend remains bullish.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong staking inflows and recent price surge indicate robust investor confidence and potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and maintain bullish sentiment suggests potential for upward movement, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price volatility and a significant drop in value suggest caution. Despite high speculative interest, the lack of bullish signals justifies reducing exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and its role in providing market liquidity, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent amidst the current market conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark, although it has recently pulled back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, holding key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced significant volatility, with a recent 12% drop, though speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with substantial new issuance, indicating ongoing demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100,000 mark and bullish momentum in technical indicators suggest potential for further gains. However, caution is warranted due to profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and the persistence of bullish sentiment suggest continued upward potential, though the lack of a clear breakout warrants a moderate score.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop, despite high speculative interest, suggest caution and a need to reduce exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT issuance supports market liquidity, the current market environment does not strongly favor increased or decreased exposure to stablecoins."
2024-11-24 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the psychological $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance, driven by increased staking and a significant price surge in November, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, defending key support levels with potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced a sharp decline, reflecting increased volatility despite high speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance suggests robust market liquidity, with strategic moves like the potential BTC loan venture indicating its ongoing relevance in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, BTC's approach towards $100K and bullish on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate positive sentiment, though recent technicals are mixed.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of support levels suggest potential for upward movement, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price drop and increased volatility suggest caution, recommending a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — While increased issuance supports liquidity, the mixed market sentiment does not strongly favor a shift towards or away from stablecoins at this time."
2024-11-24 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook with key support levels being defended, while Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility and a notable drop in price, despite high speculative interest. Tether continues to provide market liquidity with significant new issuance, highlighting its role in supporting trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100,000 and continued bullish signals suggest potential for further gains, albeit with caution due to profit-taking.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment and reduced supply, making Ethereum an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for upward movement, supported by positive market forecasts.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price drop and volatility, despite high speculative interest, warrant a cautious approach and reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and its role in providing liquidity, maintaining a neutral stance allows flexibility in capital allocation as market conditions evolve."
2024-11-24 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a cautious undertone. Bitcoin's recent rally towards $100,000 has stalled, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows signs of investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November, although recent technical indicators suggest potential short-term weakness. Solana maintains a bullish outlook with key support levels holding and potential for further gains. Dogecoin faces volatility with a significant price drop, yet speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with substantial new issuances, although its role may shift as market conditions evolve.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's long-term bullish trend remains intact, supported by previous upward momentum and on-chain activity. However, caution is warranted due to current market hesitation.

ETH: +0.1 — While Ethereum has shown strong performance recently, technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback. Increased staking and reduced supply are supportive factors, but not enough for a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels, along with potential for a breakout, make it relatively attractive in the current market environment.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant recent price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, though high speculative interest could lead to volatility.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further volatility, maintaining some exposure to USDT provides a hedge against downside risk in other assets."

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with BTC nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating traders are taking profits and reassessing positions. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November, although technical indicators remain bearish in the short term. Solana is holding key support levels with bullish sentiment persisting, suggesting potential for further gains. Dogecoin experienced a sharp decline, reflecting high volatility and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to support market liquidity with significant new issuance, indicating a stable demand for USDT amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent profit-taking, BTC's approach to the $100,000 mark and stable on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to stalled rally momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence, though technical indicators remain bearish in the short term.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further gains, supported by positive market forecasts.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price decline and high volatility suggest caution, though speculative interest remains strong. Reducing exposure is prudent given current market conditions.

USDT: +0.2 — Continued issuance and stable demand for USDT provide a safe haven amidst market volatility, though the preference is to maintain some exposure to risk assets."
2024-11-24 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with signs of profit-taking and reassessment after recent rallies, particularly in Bitcoin, which approached but failed to sustain the $100,000 level. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with significant staking inflows and a notable price increase in November, suggesting a bullish outlook. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin, however, faces volatility with a significant drop in price, although speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance supporting trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price pullback and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Profit-taking indicates potential for further downside.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and recent price surge reflect investor confidence and reduced supply, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels indicate potential for further gains, although technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: -0.1 — High volatility and recent price drop warrant caution, despite strong speculative interest.

USDT: +0.6 — Increased market uncertainty and profit-taking in other assets suggest maintaining higher stablecoin exposure for liquidity and risk management."
2024-11-24 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be cautious, with recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite Bitcoin's approach towards the $100,000 mark, it has pulled back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance in November, but recent technical indicators suggest a lack of immediate bullish momentum. Solana maintains a bullish outlook with support at $240, although it has experienced recent price declines. Dogecoin faces significant volatility, with a notable drop in price despite high speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuances, indicating a preference for stability amidst market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite nearing $100K, BTC's recent pullback and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Profit-taking and market hesitation warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.2 — While ETH has experienced a strong November, current technicals are neutral. However, increased staking inflows and reduced supply support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.1 — SOL's bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels are encouraging, but recent price declines and lack of immediate bullish signals suggest only a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.5 — Significant recent price declines and low on-chain activity indicate a bearish short-term outlook, justifying a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — With increased market volatility and uncertainty, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity, supporting a moderate increase in exposure."
2024-11-24 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark before pulling back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining key support levels with bullish sentiment, while Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with recent losses despite high speculative interest. Tether's issuance has increased, enhancing market liquidity, and potential Bitcoin-backed loan ventures indicate a strategic move to support further market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to market hesitation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong performance in November and increased staking activity signal investor confidence and potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further gains, though the lack of a clear breakout warrants moderate optimism.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent volatility and mixed signals from derivatives demand and price movements suggest a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: -0.3 — Increased issuance and potential capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings as market conditions stabilize."
2024-11-24 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin's recent approach towards $100,000 was met with profit-taking, indicating hesitancy among traders to push beyond this psychological barrier. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with significant staking inflows and a notable price increase in November, suggesting a bullish outlook. Solana maintains a bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin experienced a sharp decline, highlighting its volatility, but the surge in open interest suggests continued speculative interest. Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, indicating a stable environment for risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent profit-taking, Bitcoin's proximity to $100,000 and active on-chain activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a significant monthly price increase indicate robust investor confidence and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment and support at key levels provide a positive outlook, though the lack of immediate breakout signals warrants moderate confidence.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and recent price drop are offset by strong speculative interest, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — While generally stable, the increased issuance and liquidity support a slight preference for holding amid mixed market conditions."
2024-11-24 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and reassessment by traders. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, defending key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility with a recent drop, yet high open interest indicates continued speculative interest. Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, with potential new ventures enhancing its role in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and high on-chain activity suggest underlying strength, though caution is warranted due to profit-taking.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong November performance and increased staking inflows indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, supporting further gains.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for continued upward movement, though technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and recent price drop offset by strong speculative interest, resulting in a neutral stance as market direction remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.2 — While Tether's increased issuance supports liquidity, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is prudent as risk appetite grows across other assets."
2024-11-24 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining bullish sentiment, defending key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced volatility, with recent gains reversing, but speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to support market liquidity with significant new issuance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent profit-taking, Bitcoin's approach to $100,000 shows strong market interest, though caution is warranted given the pullback.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence, making it relatively attractive.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further gains, supported by positive market forecasts.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and speculative interest balance out, with no clear directional signal at this time.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT issuance supports liquidity, the overall market's cautious optimism suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets."
2024-11-24 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly as traders took profits. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which indicates investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains.

Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance supporting trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While BTC has shown strong recent gains, the momentum has stalled slightly. The market is reassessing, but on-chain activity remains robust, suggesting potential for continued support.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's strong performance in November and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, supporting further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and the persistence of bullish sentiment suggest a favorable outlook for further gains, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite high speculative interest, recent volatility and price declines suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT remains a neutral allocation. While it supports market liquidity, the current environment favors risk assets over stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly due to profit-taking. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, indicating investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish momentum, defending key support levels, while Dogecoin experiences high volatility with significant speculative interest. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, suggesting a favorable backdrop for risk assets. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100K mark and strong on-chain activity suggest continued bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive momentum and investor confidence, justifying a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's defense of key support levels and bullish market forecasts support a positive outlook, though with slightly less conviction than ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and speculative interest create uncertainty, leading to a neutral stance as the market assesses direction.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable, though maintaining some liquidity is prudent."
2024-11-24 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
