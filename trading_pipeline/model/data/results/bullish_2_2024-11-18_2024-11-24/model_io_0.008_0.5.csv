2024-11-18 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing potential for upward movement. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase, and technical indicators suggest a continued uptrend. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, although rising exchange reserves may indicate some caution among investors. Solana has been buoyed by strong network performance and speculation around a potential ETF, pushing it near multi-year highs. Dogecoin's community-driven events and bullish technical patterns suggest potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's new issuance indicates rising demand for liquidity, though its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive position in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest further gains, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a breakout level with reduced fees and rising reserves, indicating potential for upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment and ETF speculation support continued strength, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community events and bullish patterns provide a speculative opportunity, though with higher risk.

USDT: -0.7 — As risk appetite increases, capital should be rotated out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with growth potential."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly positive with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of strength. Bitcoin is experiencing a strong uptrend, bolstered by significant institutional purchases, such as MicroStrategy's recent acquisition. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, while Solana is benefiting from bullish sentiment and ETF speculation, reaching a multi-year high. Dogecoin is seeing increased community activity and technical patterns suggest potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance indicates rising demand for stablecoins, although overall market conditions suggest a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest further gains, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout, supported by accumulation signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment and ETF speculation are driving price gains, indicating further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community activity and bullish technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though with higher volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins in favor of higher-yielding assets."
2024-11-18 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, with notable upward momentum in several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's strong uptrend is reinforced by significant institutional buying, as highlighted by MicroStrategy's substantial BTC acquisition. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, while Solana continues to benefit from ETF speculation and network strength, reaching multi-year highs. Dogecoin is experiencing positive sentiment driven by community engagement and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance indicates increased demand for liquidity, although the broader market trend suggests a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and a firm uptrend provide a solid foundation for further gains. The recent large purchase by MicroStrategy is a significant bullish signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees suggest positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.7 — Benefiting from ETF speculation and network strength, with recent price action indicating strong bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive community sentiment and technical patterns hint at potential upside, though the market cap remains relatively small compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-18 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of potential upward momentum. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend suggest a positive outlook. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, indicating a possible breakout, while Solana has reached a multi-year high, driven by strong network performance and ETF speculation. Dogecoin has seen increased community activity and bullish technical patterns, hinting at potential gains. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, though the broader market's risk appetite may be shifting towards more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend support a bullish stance. The recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy reinforces confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees suggest growing investor interest.

SOL: +0.7 — Surging to a 3-year high with strong network fundamentals and ETF speculation driving positive sentiment. Technical indicators support further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community engagement and bullish technical patterns suggest potential for upward movement, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — While demand for stablecoins remains, the overall market's risk appetite is increasing, leading to potential capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-18 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which can sometimes exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the crypto market is showing signs of bullish momentum, particularly with Bitcoin and Solana, which are experiencing positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent large purchase by MicroStrategy and Solana's network strength and ETF speculation are driving optimism. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and bullish technical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether's new issuance reflects strong demand for liquidity, though it remains a stable, low-risk asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional buying and a solid uptrend. Positive technicals and news suggest further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees are positive indicators.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong price action and positive sentiment driven by ETF speculation and network strength. Technicals support further upside.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and bullish technical patterns suggest potential for gains, though less pronounced than other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a rotation out of stablecoins as investors seek higher returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and stable S&P 500 performance. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong, which can sometimes exert downward pressure on crypto assets, but the overall sentiment in the crypto market remains positive. Bitcoin is experiencing strong momentum, bolstered by significant institutional purchases and a solid uptrend. Ethereum is nearing a breakout point, with increased exchange reserves indicating potential accumulation. Solana is riding high on network strength and ETF speculation, while Dogecoin has a positive community-driven sentiment with potential for a rally. Tether remains stable, with new issuances indicating robust demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and a solid uptrend suggest further gains. On-chain activity supports bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Increased reserves and lower fees indicate accumulation.

SOL: +0.7 — Positive sentiment driven by network strength and ETF speculation. Recent price surge and technical signals are supportive.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and potential for a technical rally provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-11-18 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by significant developments and strong technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a robust uptrend, bolstered by MicroStrategy's substantial purchase, signaling confidence in its long-term potential. Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout, with increasing exchange reserves suggesting accumulation. Solana is benefiting from network strength and ETF speculation, pushing it to new highs. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns indicating potential for a major rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity reflects rising demand for stablecoins, although its technical indicators suggest a possible short-term breakdown.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators, suggests further gains are likely.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout, supported by accumulation signals and reduced fees.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's recent price surge and ETF speculation, along with strong network fundamentals, indicate continued bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's community-driven momentum and technical patterns pointing to a potential rally make it an attractive short-term allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-11-18 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant institutional investment by MicroStrategy support a bullish outlook. The technical uptrend and positive news reinforce the potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees suggest a favorable environment for price appreciation.

SOL: +0.7 — Benefiting from network strength and ETF speculation, Solana's price surge and bullish sentiment make it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns hint at a potential rally, though the asset remains more speculative compared to others.

2024-11-18 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend signal potential for further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, suggesting a possible breakout. Solana is experiencing a surge due to network strength and ETF speculation, while Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns indicating a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting on Ethereum suggests increased demand for liquidity, although its technical indicators remain neutral.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum, supported by significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators. The macroeconomic environment and news suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level with bullish sentiment and accumulation signals, indicating potential for a breakout. However, it is slightly less attractive than Bitcoin due to its current price position.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is benefiting from strong network performance and ETF speculation, driving its price near a 3-year high. The asset shows positive momentum and investor interest.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Dogecoin's community-driven events and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though it remains a riskier asset.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a slight reduction in USDT allocation to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-18 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with strong upward momentum and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to show a firm uptrend, supported by significant purchases from institutional players like MicroStrategy. Ethereum is nearing a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, while Solana is experiencing a surge due to network strength and ETF speculation. Dogecoin, while volatile, has technical patterns suggesting potential for a major rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting indicates rising demand for stablecoins, although the broader market seems to be favoring riskier assets given the bullish sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant institutional buying suggest continued price appreciation. The macroeconomic context is supportive of risk assets, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. The increase in exchange balances and reduced fees indicate accumulation, supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Recent price surge and ETF speculation are driving strong investor interest. The positive sentiment and technical indicators suggest further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While volatile, the community engagement and technical patterns hint at potential upside. However, the risk remains higher compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into riskier assets. The recent minting suggests liquidity support, but the preference is for growth assets in the current environment."
2024-11-18 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend suggest potential for further gains. Ethereum is eyeing a breakout, supported by increased reserves and lower fees, indicating accumulation. Solana is experiencing a surge due to network strength and ETF speculation, reaching a 3-year high. Dogecoin has mixed signals, with community-driven events and potential for a rally, but recent price drops indicate volatility. USDT remains stable, with new issuances suggesting liquidity support, though the broader market's risk appetite may reduce demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant institutional buying indicate a robust bullish trend, making BTC a preferred allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Potential breakout and accumulation signals suggest a positive outlook, though recent price decreases warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued price increases and positive sentiment from ETF speculation support a bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite community enthusiasm and potential technical rallies, recent price volatility and lack of clear bullish momentum suggest a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital may rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-18 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish signals emerging for several key cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to show strong upward momentum, supported by significant institutional purchases and technical indicators suggesting further gains. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, with potential for a breakout, although recent increases in exchange reserves suggest some caution. Solana is experiencing a surge in interest, driven by speculation around a potential ETF and strong network fundamentals. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns indicating a possible rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance indicates rising demand for liquidity, but its price is slightly below the peg, suggesting some market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical indicators support a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic environment remains favorable for Bitcoin as a hedge.

ETH: +0.3 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout. However, increased exchange reserves suggest some caution, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong price action and positive sentiment driven by ETF speculation and network strength. This makes Solana an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for gains, though the overall market impact remains moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With rising risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-11-18 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals: Bitcoin remains in a strong uptrend bolstered by significant institutional purchases, suggesting continued bullish sentiment. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, though recent increases in exchange reserves could indicate some selling pressure. Solana has been performing well, driven by positive network developments and ETF speculation, maintaining its bullish trajectory. Dogecoin's community-driven events and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, but it remains speculative. Tether's recent minting activity indicates increased demand for liquidity, reflecting a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and technical uptrend suggest continued bullish momentum. Positive news reinforces confidence in further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout, though increased exchange reserves warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued bullish sentiment and ETF speculation provide strong support for further price gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community events and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though it remains speculative and volatile.

USDT: -0.4 — While demand for liquidity remains, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-11-18 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum. Bitcoin's recent large purchase by MicroStrategy and its technical uptrend suggest potential for further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, and a breakout could trigger a new bullish wave. Solana is experiencing strong network performance and investor interest, driven by ETF speculation. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns indicating potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests increased demand and liquidity, but in a bullish market environment, capital may rotate out of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by large institutional purchases and technical indicators. Positive macroeconomic context and news bolster confidence in further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout. Increasing reserves and falling fees indicate accumulation, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Network strength and ETF speculation are driving bullish sentiment. Recent price gains and positive news suggest continued upward movement.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for gains, though less confidence compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, as investors seek higher returns in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-18 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong upward momentum, bolstered by substantial purchases from institutional players like MicroStrategy, which reinforces its long-term bullish outlook. Ethereum is on the cusp of a potential breakout, supported by rising reserves and decreasing fees, indicating accumulation. Solana is experiencing a surge in interest due to speculation around a potential ETF and strong network fundamentals, pushing it to multi-year highs. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a possible rally, though it remains speculative. Tether's recent minting activities highlight growing demand for liquidity, though its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive posture in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest continued price appreciation. Positive sentiment and on-chain activity support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees indicate positive momentum.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network fundamentals and ETF speculation are driving price gains. Positive sentiment and technical indicators support further upside.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for gains, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-18 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish signals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent purchase by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend suggest continued investor confidence. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, supported by increased exchange reserves and lower fees. Solana is benefiting from network strength and ETF speculation, maintaining its upward trajectory. Dogecoin's community-driven events and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though it remains speculative. USDT's new issuance indicates strong demand for liquidity, but in a bullish environment, capital may rotate away from stablecoins into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant institutional buying support a positive outlook. The macro environment and technical indicators are favorable.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a breakout level with supportive on-chain metrics and reduced fees, indicating potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued positive sentiment and ETF speculation provide a bullish backdrop, although recent price dips warrant cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community events and bullish technical patterns suggest potential upside, but the speculative nature of DOGE warrants a modest score.

USDT: -0.4 — While demand remains strong, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation into more volatile assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-18 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy and its strong uptrend signal a positive outlook, supported by robust on-chain activity. Ethereum is on the verge of a potential breakout, with increased exchange reserves indicating accumulation. Solana is benefiting from ETF speculation and network strength, pushing it to multi-year highs. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm, though its technical indicators remain mixed. Meanwhile, Tether's new issuance suggests increasing demand for liquidity, though its stable nature makes it less attractive in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant institutional investment signal further potential gains. On-chain activity is robust, supporting a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with accumulation signals; potential for a breakout makes it attractive, though slightly less so than BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and network strength, despite some recent price volatility. Overall, it remains a strong candidate for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite community enthusiasm, technical indicators are mixed, and recent price decreases suggest caution. No clear signal for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With rising risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-11-18 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum supported by positive technical indicators and significant news developments. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and Ethereum's potential breakout are key drivers. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment due to ETF speculation and network strength, while Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Tether's recent minting activity indicates rising demand for stablecoins, but the broader market's risk appetite seems to be increasing, potentially reducing the relative attractiveness of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and significant institutional investment news suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching key resistance with bullish momentum and accumulation signals; potential for breakout supports increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and network strength, though technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns hinting at a rally support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more capital to growth assets."
2024-11-18 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with a moderate U.S. Dollar Index and a low volatility index, indicating a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment for risk assets. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by significant institutional buying and a robust technical uptrend. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with increasing exchange reserves suggesting accumulation. Solana is benefiting from positive sentiment and speculation around an ETF, although technical indicators are not yet fully supportive. Dogecoin is seeing community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting potential for a rally. Tether's recent minting suggests increased demand for liquidity, although its role as a stablecoin typically sees reduced allocation in bullish conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and technical uptrend, coupled with positive news, make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a breakout level with accumulation signals; however, resistance remains a challenge, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive sentiment and ETF speculation provide a supportive backdrop, though technicals are not yet fully aligned for a stronger buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community enthusiasm and potential rally signals offer some upside, but the lack of strong technical confirmation suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-11-18 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend suggest continued growth potential. Ethereum is also showing signs of a potential breakout, supported by increased exchange reserves and reduced network fees. Solana is experiencing a surge due to network strength and speculation around a potential ETF, while Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and optimistic technical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, although the broader market's risk appetite may lead to capital rotation away from USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and significant institutional investment by MicroStrategy support a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.7 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout, supported by increased reserves and lower fees, indicating accumulation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment driven by network performance and ETF speculation, although technical indicators are currently neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and potential for a rally based on technical patterns, despite recent low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.3 — While demand remains strong, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on growth in other assets."
2024-11-19 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies, while Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals. Solana shows strong ecosystem growth with record trading volumes on DEXs and a significant market cap milestone. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, with potential for further gains, while Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and steady interest rates, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive policy expectations create a strong bullish outlook. On-chain activity and technical indicators support continued upward momentum.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and recent price volatility suggest a cautious approach. Technical indicators remain positive, but mixed news tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX activity and market cap growth highlight Solana's ecosystem strength, warranting increased allocation despite neutral technical signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent rally and bullish breakout pattern provide a positive outlook, but low on-chain activity suggests a measured increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and strong performance in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on growth opportunities elsewhere."
2024-11-19 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and positive developments in the Solana ecosystem. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500 is bolstered by expectations of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals, faces bearish investor sentiment, potentially limiting its upside. Solana's record trading volumes on DEXs and its surpassing of major companies in market cap highlight its growing ecosystem strength. Dogecoin shows potential for significant gains, driven by a bullish breakout pattern. However, Tether faces challenges with a recent security breach, although it hasn't affected customer funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive policy expectations provide strong upward momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite bearish sentiment, Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong, with staking developments offering potential upside.

SOL: +0.5 — Record DEX volumes and a strong market cap position indicate robust growth and ecosystem strength.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish breakout potential and recent price rally suggest moderate upside, though caution is warranted given its volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current exposure as a hedge against potential market volatility, despite the recent security breach."
2024-11-19 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin's recent surge is driven by positive macroeconomic developments and potential crypto-friendly policies, while Dogecoin benefits from a bullish breakout pattern. Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals and new staking opportunities, faces bearish sentiment from investors. Solana continues to demonstrate ecosystem strength with record trading volumes and a significant market cap, although technical indicators remain neutral. Tether's recent security breach has not impacted customer funds, but it highlights potential vulnerabilities in stablecoin infrastructure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive news regarding potential crypto-friendly policies provide strong upward momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals and staking news, bearish investor sentiment and recent price decreases suggest a neutral stance for now.

SOL: +0.3 — Record DEX trading volumes and a strong market cap highlight Solana's ecosystem strength, though technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong bullish sentiment and a potential breakout pattern suggest further upside potential, supported by recent price increases.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall positive sentiment in the crypto market, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-11-19 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin experiencing significant upward momentum. Bitcoin's surge is supported by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results, while Dogecoin's rally is driven by bullish breakout patterns. Ethereum, however, faces bearish investor sentiment despite strong fundamentals and new staking opportunities. Solana shows strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no impact on customer funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive news regarding ETF developments suggest strong upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and recent price decreases suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signal for allocation changes.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record DEX volumes and market cap growth indicate a robust ecosystem, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains, making it a favorable asset for increased exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-11-19 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism around crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals, faces bearish investor sentiment, which might limit its upward movement. Solana shows strong ecosystem growth with record DEX trading volumes and a significant market cap increase, surpassing major companies like Nike and Sony. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, supported by bullish breakout patterns suggesting further potential gains. Meanwhile, Tether's stability remains intact despite a recent security breach, as no customer funds were affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and on-chain activity, suggests continued growth potential. The recent all-time high adds confidence to its bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite bearish sentiment, Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong, and the addition of staking rewards via ETP could attract more investors, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem strength and record DEX volumes indicate robust growth, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for further gains, as indicated by bullish patterns, justify a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a strategic opportunity to rotate some capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-19 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin experiencing significant upward momentum. Bitcoin's price surge is supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions and recent ETF developments, suggesting a bullish outlook. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to reach previous highs. Solana continues to show strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a notable market cap increase, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin's rally and potential for further gains highlight increased investor interest, while Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by macroeconomic factors and ETF news, suggests continued bullish potential. The recent all-time high further solidifies its attractiveness.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite positive technical signals, bearish sentiment and doubts about price recovery weigh on Ethereum's outlook, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's impressive DEX volume and market cap growth signal strong ecosystem health, making it an attractive allocation despite mixed technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for significant gains, as indicated by bullish breakout patterns, make it a favorable asset in the current market environment.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the recent security breach, USDT remains stable, serving as a neutral holding amidst a generally bullish market sentiment."
2024-11-19 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, driven by optimism around crypto-friendly policies and positive ETF developments. Dogecoin is experiencing a strong rally with potential for further gains, supported by a bullish breakout pattern. Solana is also showing strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap, indicating robust ecosystem growth. In contrast, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Tether has been impacted by a security breach, though it hasn't affected customer funds. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on sentiment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, all-time high, and positive ETF news suggest continued bullish potential, making it a top allocation priority.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals warrant caution, suggesting a slight reduction in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's robust DEX activity and significant market cap growth indicate strong ecosystem health, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for further gains due to a bullish breakout pattern make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-19 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing significant upward momentum. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500 is supported by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Solana also shows strength with record trading volumes on its decentralized exchanges and surpassing major companies in market cap. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Tether experienced a security breach, although it did not affect customer funds. The macroeconomic environment, with a stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility, suggests a cautiously optimistic market outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum, supported by positive news and on-chain activity, makes it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong ecosystem activity and positive news support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Bullish breakout patterns and recent price surges indicate potential for further gains, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-11-19 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Solana showing strong ecosystem growth. Bitcoin's surge is supported by hopes for crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results, while Solana's DEXs hit record trading volumes, indicating robust network activity. Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Dogecoin has shown potential for significant gains, although recent price movements have been mixed. Tether experienced a security breach, but it did not affect customer funds, maintaining its role as a stable asset in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators, suggests continued growth potential. The recent all-time high and ETF developments further bolster its attractiveness.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, Ethereum's technical indicators and bearish sentiment suggest a cautious approach. Hold current positions without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive DEX activity and market cap growth highlight its strength. The positive breakout signals and news support an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While DOGE has shown potential for significant gains, recent price volatility warrants a modest increase in exposure, given the bullish breakout pattern.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing USDT holdings slightly in favor of more volatile assets could capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-19 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism around crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Bitcoin's strong momentum is further supported by Grayscale's ETF developments. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite its strong fundamentals and recent ETP staking integration. Solana continues to show strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap milestone, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin is experiencing a notable rally, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a possible breakout. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, though recent security concerns may affect its appeal.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news around ETF developments and policy optimism make it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest caution in increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record DEX volumes and significant market cap achievement highlight its growing ecosystem, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — The recent price rally and bullish breakout potential make Dogecoin appealing for short-term gains, though with moderate confidence.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and strong performance in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on market momentum."
2024-11-19 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high due to favorable macroeconomic conditions and potential crypto-friendly policies. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Solana shows robust ecosystem activity with record DEX volumes. Dogecoin is experiencing a bullish breakout pattern, hinting at potential further gains, while Tether's recent security breach raises concerns, although it hasn't affected customer funds. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about ETF developments and all-time high prices suggest continued bullishness. The macro context also supports risk-on sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and technical indicators suggest caution. The recent price drop and lack of bullish signals warrant a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive news about DEX volumes and market cap growth, combined with bullish technical indicators, make Solana an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish breakout patterns and recent price surge indicate potential for further gains. Positive sentiment and technical signals support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With risk appetite increasing and positive momentum in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital to more promising opportunities is advisable."
2024-11-19 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, driven by Bitcoin's recent all-time high surpassing $93.5K, fueled by optimism around crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. This has created a positive ripple effect across other cryptocurrencies, with Solana and Dogecoin showing strong momentum and positive news. Solana's ecosystem strength is highlighted by record DEX trading volumes and a significant market cap milestone, while Dogecoin is buoyed by bullish breakout patterns suggesting potential for further gains. However, Ethereum faces bearish investor sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Tether is dealing with a security breach incident, though it hasn't impacted customer funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong momentum and positive news about ETF developments and policy optimism suggest continued upward potential, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite Ethereum's strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest caution, justifying a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's robust ecosystem activity and positive news about market cap growth and DEX volumes support a favorable allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent rally and bullish technical patterns indicate potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-11-19 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions and crypto-friendly political developments. This bullish sentiment is reflected in the strong price action and positive news for Bitcoin. Ethereum, however, is facing bearish sentiment despite its solid fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to reach previous highs. Solana is experiencing significant ecosystem growth, evidenced by record trading volumes on its DEXs and a substantial market cap increase. Dogecoin is showing strong momentum with a recent rally and potential for further gains, supported by bullish technical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, all-time high, and supportive news suggest continued bullishness, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest a neutral stance until clearer direction emerges.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's robust ecosystem growth and positive market cap developments indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price rally and bullish breakout potential make Dogecoin attractive, though it remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-11-19 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism around crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Bitcoin's technical indicators show strong upward momentum, supported by positive news such as Grayscale's ETF share split. Dogecoin also shows significant bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a potential rally towards $1. Solana's ecosystem continues to demonstrate strength, with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone. In contrast, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to reach previous highs. Tether remains stable, though recent news of a treasury wallet breach has raised some concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by all-time high prices and positive ETF news, suggests continued bullishness. On-chain activity and technical indicators reinforce this sentiment.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The market appears to favor other assets currently.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record DEX volumes and strong market cap growth highlight its ecosystem strength. Positive technical indicators further support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains. Positive market sentiment and technical indicators are supportive.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish trends across major cryptocurrencies, there's a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capture potential gains."
2024-11-19 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bullish, driven by Bitcoin's surge to an all-time high above $93.5K, fueled by optimism around potential crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Bitcoin's technical indicators also show strong upward momentum, suggesting continued strength. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite positive developments like staking rewards, reflecting doubts about its ability to revisit yearly highs. Solana continues to demonstrate ecosystem strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap milestone. Dogecoin is experiencing a notable rally, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a significant breakout. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about ETF developments and all-time high price levels suggest continued bullishness.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and sideways technical indicators warrant caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Record DEX volumes and surpassing major companies in market cap highlight Solana's growing ecosystem strength.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-11-19 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin hitting an all-time high driven by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Bitcoin's strong upward momentum is supported by both technical indicators and positive news, such as the Grayscale ETF share split. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite its strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to reach previous highs. Solana shows significant strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a high market cap, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin has experienced a recent rally, with bullish patterns suggesting potential further gains. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, which did not affect customer funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and positive news, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to, especially given its recent all-time high and supportive macroeconomic context.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest a cautious approach, maintaining current exposure without increasing it.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong ecosystem growth and positive market activity, coupled with a robust market cap, make it a favorable asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent bullish momentum and positive news suggest potential for further gains, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall market showing signs of bullishness, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is prudent to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-19 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. This has bolstered bullish sentiment across the market, with Dogecoin also experiencing a notable rally. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, and Solana shows signs of strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap increase. Tether's recent security breach has not affected customer funds, but it may raise concerns about stablecoin security. The macroeconomic environment, with a stable S&P 500 and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on approach, but caution remains due to the high U.S. dollar index.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, all-time high, and positive ETF news suggest continued bullishness. On-chain activity supports this view.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest caution. No immediate catalysts for a rebound.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate robust ecosystem health. Technical signals are mixed, but fundamentals are supportive.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent rally and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains, but technical signals are not uniformly strong.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and strong performance in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-11-19 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. This positive sentiment is somewhat tempered by bearish outlooks on Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals and new staking opportunities. Solana continues to show strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin has experienced a recent rally, with potential for further gains, although recent price decreases suggest volatility. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments suggest continued upward potential. The recent all-time high reinforces its attractiveness.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The market seems to favor other assets at the moment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's impressive DEX volume and market cap achievements indicate strong ecosystem health, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent bullish news and potential for significant price increases make DOGE a moderately attractive option, though recent price volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-19 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, particularly for Bitcoin, which has recently hit an all-time high, driven by hopes of favorable regulatory developments. The technical indicators for BTC show a consistent buy signal, supported by strong on-chain activity. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite its solid fundamentals, as reflected in its sideways technical indicators. Solana is showing strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone, although recent price action has been mixed. Dogecoin has seen a notable rally, with analysts predicting further gains, but technical indicators remain mixed. USDT remains stable, but recent news of a security breach could impact its perceived safety, although it still serves as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and robust on-chain activity, makes it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a hold position.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong ecosystem activity and market cap growth indicate potential upside, although recent price action requires cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent rally and bullish news suggest potential for further gains, but mixed technicals warrant a moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — While still a safe haven, the security breach news and overall bullish market sentiment suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-20 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant macroeconomic and political developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong pro-crypto political developments and ETF optimism are driving positive sentiment. On-chain activity is also robust, supporting further capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technicals, breaking the $3K level and potential for further gains provide a moderate buy signal. News of ETF activity adds to the positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive news regarding ETF filings and bullish price targets, combined with normal on-chain activity, suggest potential for upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative interest due to political news, but technical indicators do not strongly support a buy signal. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could weigh on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing positive sentiment due to political developments and institutional interest, pushing it towards new highs. Ethereum is also showing strength, breaking the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains. Solana's bullish sentiment is driven by ETF news and technical patterns suggesting a significant upward move. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to speculative news, while Tether continues to see increased demand, as evidenced by recent minting activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong news sentiment and institutional interest are driving Bitcoin's price upwards, supported by a favorable macroeconomic backdrop and positive technical indicators.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's break above $3,000 and potential for further gains, coupled with positive news regarding ETF developments, suggest a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish technical patterns and ETF-related news are supportive of Solana, indicating potential for significant price appreciation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative news causing price swings, there is no clear directional trend, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of higher-yielding opportunities."
2024-11-20 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment reflects a cautiously optimistic environment, with notable bullish developments across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's price surge near $95K, driven by positive news surrounding Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, suggests a strong upward momentum. Ethereum has also shown resilience, breaking past the $3K mark, although technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is gaining attention with potential ETF filings and bullish price predictions, indicating a favorable outlook. Dogecoin's price swings are influenced by political hype, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests anticipation of increased market demand. Overall, the market shows signs of bullishness, but with some caution due to mixed technical signals and macroeconomic factors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. The price surge and positive news suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, breaking the $3K level and positive news provide a moderate bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF filings and bullish price predictions support a favorable allocation, despite mixed technicals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Political hype has led to price swings, but lack of strong technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-20 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $95K due to pro-crypto political developments and ETF optimism. Ethereum's recent surge past $3K and institutional interest in Bitcoin, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals' investment, further support the bullish sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing speculative interest, with Solana nearing all-time highs and Dogecoin seeing price swings due to political hype. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting of 1 billion USDT suggests anticipation of increased market demand, though the stablecoin's role as a safe haven may diminish if bullish trends continue.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF optimism and institutional adoption. Despite mixed technical signals, the macroeconomic context and news support a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from breaking the $3K mark and potential for further gains. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from ETF filing and price nearing all-time highs. Despite technical neutrality, the positive news flow justifies increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Political developments and speculative interest provide a short-term boost, though technical indicators are neutral. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation towards more volatile assets."
2024-11-20 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a cautiously optimistic sentiment, driven by significant developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in price, nearing $95K, fueled by positive news surrounding Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals' investment. Ethereum has broken the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, while Solana is approaching all-time highs, supported by ETF filings and bullish price targets. Dogecoin has seen volatility due to political news involving high-profile figures like Musk. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, indicating anticipation of increased market demand. Overall, the market shows signs of bullishness, with potential for further upside across major assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's proximity to all-time highs, coupled with the Bitwise ETF filing and bullish price predictions, indicate strong potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Although Dogecoin has experienced volatility, the political news involving Musk and trading buzz provide a slight positive sentiment, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market sentiment leaning towards bullishness and increased risk appetite, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2024-11-20 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $95K mark, driven by positive news regarding Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, which has also led to institutional interest as seen with Acurx Pharmaceuticals adding BTC to its treasury. Ethereum has broken the $3K barrier, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a move toward $3,800. Solana is also in the spotlight with a proposed ETF and bullish price predictions, while Dogecoin experiences volatility amid political speculation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting of 1 billion USDT suggests anticipation of increased market demand, although its stable nature makes it less attractive in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF optimism and institutional interest, coupled with positive news, supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K mark and potential for further gains make ETH attractive, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from ETF news and bullish price predictions suggest potential for significant upside.

DOGE: +0.2 — Political speculation and recent price swings indicate some potential for gains, but with higher volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-20 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments across several assets. Bitcoin is nearing $95K, driven by positive sentiment from Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, which is also reflected in institutional interest as seen with Acurx Pharmaceuticals' investment. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a move toward $3,800. Solana is also showing bullish potential with Bitwise filing for a SOL ETF and predictions of a significant price increase. Dogecoin is experiencing price volatility, influenced by political developments and speculative trading. Meanwhile, Tether has minted additional USDT, indicating expectations of increased market demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF optimism and institutional interest, coupled with positive news sentiment, suggests further potential gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking the $3K mark and positive news regarding ETF developments support a bullish outlook, despite mixed technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF filing and bullish price predictions, although technical indicators are still neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Political developments and speculative trading have increased volatility, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-11-20 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95,000 driven by positive news such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, while Solana is also showing bullish patterns with ETF filings and high price targets. Dogecoin has experienced price swings due to political hype, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. Positive news flow and recent price increases suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and breaking key price levels, coupled with positive news on ETF developments, indicate a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment with ETF filings and high price targets, along with recent price increases, support a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political hype and recent price swings, the lack of strong technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-11-20 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $95K following positive news about Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains, while Solana is also showing bullish patterns with a new ETF filing. Dogecoin experienced speculative spikes due to political hype, and Tether has been actively minting USDT, indicating anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a cautiously optimistic environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with ETF optimism and institutional interest. The recent price surge and positive news support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's break above $3K and bullish momentum signal a favorable environment. The Grayscale ETF split adds to the positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bullish pattern and ETF filing indicate potential for further gains. The technical indicators are turning positive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative spikes, Dogecoin lacks strong technical or fundamental support for a directional move.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-20 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments, including Bitcoin's surge past $95K due to favorable political developments and institutional interest, as well as Ethereum's rise above $3K with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing strong bullish patterns, with ETF filings and price targets suggesting continued upward momentum. Dogecoin experienced volatility due to political speculation, while Tether's recent minting indicates anticipation of increased market activity. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum, ETF optimism, and institutional interest provide a robust bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's break above $3K and potential for further gains, coupled with ETF developments, suggest a positive trend, though slightly less pronounced than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bullish technical patterns and ETF filing indicate positive sentiment, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political speculation-induced volatility, there is no clear directional trend or sustained momentum to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on bullish trends in other assets."
2024-11-20 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $95K due to favorable political developments and ETF optimism. Ethereum has also shown strength, breaking the $3,000 mark with potential for further gains. Solana is receiving attention with ETF filings and bullish price predictions. However, Dogecoin's recent price volatility seems more speculative, influenced by political news rather than fundamental strength. The macroeconomic backdrop is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no drastic shifts in key indicators like the S&P 500 or the U.S. dollar index. This environment suggests a cautious but optimistic approach to risk assets, with a potential rotation out of stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest, makes it a preferred asset for capital allocation. The pro-crypto political developments further enhance its attractiveness.

**ETH: +0.6** — Ethereum's break above $3,000 and positive news regarding ETF developments suggest continued upward potential. The technical indicators also support a bullish stance.

**SOL: +0.5** — Solana's bullish momentum and ETF filing news provide a positive outlook. Although not as strong as BTC or ETH, it remains a favorable asset due to its growth potential.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Despite speculative interest and political news, Dogecoin lacks strong technical or fundamental support. Its recent price swings suggest caution, warranting a neutral stance.

**USDT: -0.5** — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-20 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, which have positively impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, nearing $95K, supported by institutional interest and positive news. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing bullish patterns, with predictions of significant price increases. Dogecoin has experienced volatility due to political hype, but lacks strong technical support. USDT remains stable, with increased minting indicating anticipation of market demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news, including ETF optimism and institutional interest, support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking the $3K barrier and potential for further gains, along with positive news, suggest a favorable environment for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish patterns and ETF-related news indicate potential for significant price increases, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political hype and recent volatility, technical indicators do not support a strong buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-20 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by positive news such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Bitcoin is nearing $95K, supported by institutional interest, while Ethereum has broken past $3K, with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing strength, with ETF filings and bullish price targets. Dogecoin experienced volatility due to political speculation, but lacks strong technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity, though its role remains primarily as a stable asset in times of uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, including ETF optimism and institutional interest, support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking key price levels with bullish momentum and positive news, though slightly less strong than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news and technical indicators suggest potential for further gains, though less pronounced than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price swings, lack of strong technical signals and reliance on speculative news limit conviction.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted."
2024-11-20 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by positive news such as ETF developments and institutional interest. Bitcoin is nearing $95K, bolstered by political developments and ETF optimism, while Ethereum has broken past $3K with potential for further gains. Solana shows bullish potential with ETF filings and price predictions, although recent price fluctuations suggest some volatility. Dogecoin has experienced speculative price swings, largely influenced by political news, but lacks strong technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand, although its role as a stablecoin remains primarily defensive.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments and institutional adoption suggest continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking past $3K with bullish sentiment and ETF-related news supports further allocation, though recent volatility warrants caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news around ETF filings and bullish price predictions, despite recent price fluctuations, indicate potential for growth.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent speculative swings and lack of strong technical signals suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-20 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant bullish momentum in Bitcoin, driven by political developments and institutional interest. Ethereum has also shown strength, breaking key psychological levels, though recent technical signals suggest some caution. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment due to ETF filings and price predictions, while Dogecoin remains volatile, influenced by political news and speculative trading. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports risk-on behavior, though the U.S. dollar's strength may temper some enthusiasm. Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity, but its role remains primarily as a stable reserve.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news flow, including ETF optimism and institutional adoption, support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price pullback, breaking the $3,000 level and ETF developments provide a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from ETF filings and price predictions, coupled with strong on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political news, technical indicators show no clear buy signals, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-20 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by pro-crypto political developments and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken the $3K barrier, with potential for further gains as institutional interest grows. Solana is showing bullish patterns with ETF filings, suggesting potential for significant upside. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political hype, while Tether's recent minting indicates anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest, makes it a key asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent sell pressure, Ethereum's break above $3K and potential for further gains justify a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and ETF filings suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite political hype, technical indicators remain weak, suggesting a cautious approach to reduce exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, evidenced by Acurx's investment. Ethereum has also broken past the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains as indicated by analyst targets. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment with a potential ETF on the horizon and predictions of significant price increases. However, Dogecoin is experiencing volatility, influenced by political news and speculative trading, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in traditional financial indicators that would impact the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by both technical indicators and positive news, suggests a favorable environment for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has broken key price levels, the lack of strong technical buy signals tempers enthusiasm, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential ETF news and bullish price predictions supports a favorable outlook, despite mixed technical signals.

DOGE: -0.2 — Given the current holdings and recent volatility driven by speculative news, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent to manage risk.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate capital elsewhere is advisable."
2024-11-20 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to positive news surrounding Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Bitcoin's price has been steadily increasing, supported by bullish technical indicators and institutional interest. Ethereum is also showing signs of strength, having recently surpassed the $3,000 mark, although technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is gaining attention with a potential ETF filing and bullish price predictions, though technical signals are not yet supportive. Dogecoin has experienced volatility driven by political news and speculation, but lacks strong technical backing. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand, but the stablecoin's role remains primarily as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news flow, including ETF optimism and institutional interest, make BTC highly attractive in the current environment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technicals, the recent price surge past $3,000 and positive news regarding ETF developments provide a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF filing and bullish price predictions, though technicals are not yet fully supportive, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price swings and political news, the lack of strong technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent."
2024-11-20 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by pro-crypto political developments and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, though technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is seeing bullish sentiment with ETF filings and price predictions suggesting significant upside potential. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political news, but lacks strong technical signals. Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity, but its role as a stablecoin means it will likely see reduced demand if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with supportive news from political developments and ETF optimism. The trend and momentum signals are positive, suggesting continued strength.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, technical indicators are not yet fully supportive. However, the potential for further upside and recent ETF developments provide a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is benefiting from positive news regarding ETF filings and bullish price predictions. Despite mixed technical signals, the overall sentiment is supportive of further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political news causing price swings, technical indicators do not support a strong directional move. The asset remains volatile but lacks a clear trend.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, there is likely to be a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-20 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by positive news and developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum due to optimism around a pro-crypto political environment and institutional interest, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals adding BTC to its treasury. Ethereum has broken past the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, although technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is receiving attention with the filing of a SOL ETF and predictions of significant price increases, indicating strong bullish sentiment. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political speculation, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news, including institutional adoption and political support, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, the recent price surge past $3,000 and potential for further gains warrant a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from ETF news and price predictions, along with positive momentum signals, support a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political speculation driving temporary price swings, the lack of strong technical or fundamental support suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum has seen strong institutional interest with substantial ETF inflows, and it has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana is experiencing a surge in adoption and investor enthusiasm, reaching record highs and attracting institutional attention with a new ETF filing. Dogecoin is benefiting from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, which has bolstered its market position. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with positive news on regulatory optimism and high stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest and regained USDT dominance provide a supportive backdrop, though technicals remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Record high prices and institutional interest via ETF filing indicate strong market confidence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation, though technicals are not yet fully supportive.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive."
2024-11-21 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by positive regulatory news and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and regaining the top spot for USDT supply. Solana has hit a record high, fueled by growing adoption and institutional interest, while Dogecoin is seeing increased attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant changes in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The macroeconomic context and stablecoin inflows further support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's strong institutional interest and regained USDT dominance suggest a favorable environment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high and institutional interest, as well as bullish momentum, make it an attractive asset despite recent slight price decreases.

DOGE: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, positive news and whale accumulation provide a modest bullish sentiment.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest with significant ETF inflows, although its technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is experiencing a surge in investor enthusiasm, reaching record highs and attracting institutional attention with ETF filings. Dogecoin is benefiting from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, although technical signals remain neutral. USDT remains stable, with its dominance on Ethereum reaffirmed, but faces competition from new regulated stablecoin alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by both technical indicators and positive news regarding regulatory optimism and stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued bullish potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical indicators, the strong institutional interest reflected in ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply provide a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high prices and institutional interest through ETF filings indicate strong bullish sentiment, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While technical indicators are neutral, the appointment of Musk to a government taskforce and significant whale accumulation provide a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive in the current bullish environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by optimism around regulatory reforms and strong stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum is experiencing a resurgence in interest, with substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana is also riding a wave of enthusiasm, reaching record highs and attracting institutional attention through potential ETF offerings. Dogecoin has seen a boost in sentiment due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is seeing competition from new regulated stablecoin alternatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news on regulatory reforms and increased demand from stablecoin inflows. The technical indicators support continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from significant ETF inflows and increased USDT supply dominance, suggesting strong institutional interest and potential price appreciation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record highs and potential ETF filing indicate strong market interest and bullish momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, positive news from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation suggest potential for upward movement.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, USDT may see reduced demand, though it remains a stable reserve in the portfolio."
2024-11-21 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, which indicate growing demand for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and its reclaiming of the top spot for USDT supply. Solana has reached record highs, supported by increased adoption and the filing of a Solana ETF, suggesting rising institutional focus. Dogecoin is seeing renewed interest due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with Ethereum regaining dominance for its supply, though new regulated stablecoin alternatives are emerging in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news on potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest and positive news regarding USDT supply dominance, though technical signals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high and positive news about a potential ETF filing indicate strong bullish sentiment and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's technicals are not strongly bullish, high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a positive sentiment boost.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need to hold stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $100K due to optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and Ethereum's strong institutional interest reflected in ETF inflows. Solana continues to capture investor enthusiasm with its record highs and potential ETF developments, while Dogecoin sees renewed interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. The macroeconomic context remains stable with moderate volatility, which supports risk-taking behavior in the crypto market. However, the substantial inflow into stablecoins indicates a cautious undertone, suggesting that investors are still hedging against potential volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding regulatory optimism and stablecoin inflows suggest continued bullishness. The technical indicators support further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest through ETF inflows and reclaiming USDT dominance provide a positive outlook. The technicals have turned bullish, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Record highs and potential ETF developments indicate strong investor interest. The technical indicators are supportive, though recent price decreases suggest some caution.

DOGE: +0.3 — High-profile endorsements and whale accumulation are positive, but the lack of a strong technical buy signal tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — Despite record inflows, the overall bullish crypto sentiment suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. However, maintaining some exposure is prudent given the macroeconomic backdrop."
2024-11-21 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, bolstered by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and a surge in stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand. Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance, with strong institutional interest reflected in substantial ETF inflows. Solana is experiencing record highs, supported by growing adoption and institutional focus, as evidenced by the filing of a Solana ETF.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is exhibiting strong upward momentum, supported by both technical indicators and positive news regarding regulatory optimism and stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from strong institutional interest and reclaiming its top spot for USDT supply, indicating a favorable outlook and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's record high and the filing of a Solana ETF highlight strong investor enthusiasm and adoption, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin lacks a clear technical buy signal, the appointment of Musk to a government taskforce and significant whale accumulation provide a positive sentiment boost.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, USDT demand is likely to decrease, justifying a reduced allocation in favor of other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic indicators and strong institutional interest, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana continues to attract attention with its all-time high prices and potential ETF developments, while Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. The stablecoin market remains robust, with Tether maintaining its critical role in the ecosystem despite emerging alternatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum supported by positive news and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest and regained USDT dominance, suggesting a favorable outlook despite recent price stability.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record high and ETF filing news highlight growing investor enthusiasm, supporting a positive allocation signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin lacks strong technical signals, high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a moderate bullish sentiment.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-11-21 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $100K due to optimism around potential regulatory reforms and stablecoin inflows indicating increased crypto demand. Ethereum has seen strong institutional interest with substantial ETF inflows, and it has reclaimed the top spot for USDT supply, which further strengthens its position. Solana's record high and the filing for a Solana ETF highlight growing institutional focus on the asset. Dogecoin has gained attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, although its technical indicators are mixed. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven, but with a decreasing trend as investors show a higher risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum supported by positive news and on-chain activity. The pro-crypto sentiment and stablecoin inflows further bolster its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest and positive news regarding USDT supply dominance. Technical indicators remain bullish, supporting a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record high and ETF filing indicate strong investor interest. The positive trend and momentum signals suggest continued growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, Dogecoin has gained attention from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation, suggesting potential upward movement.

USDT: -0.3 — Although USDT remains a stable asset, the current bullish market sentiment and increased risk appetite suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on growth in other assets."
2024-11-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and strong stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is also experiencing positive momentum with significant ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply, suggesting strong institutional interest. Solana has reached a record high, reflecting growing adoption and institutional focus, as evidenced by the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is seeing renewed interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is seeing some competition from new MiCA-compliant stablecoins in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by positive news and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from institutional inflows into ETFs and reclaiming USDT supply dominance, suggesting strong market interest and potential for growth.

SOL: +0.7 — Record high prices and institutional interest, as evidenced by the Solana ETF filing, indicate strong bullish sentiment and potential for continued upward movement.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive news from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation suggests potential for upward movement, though with higher volatility.

2024-11-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive news and technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased demand, as evidenced by record stablecoin inflows. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, highlighted by significant ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana continues to attract attention with its record price highs and potential ETF developments, while Dogecoin is gaining traction due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. In contrast, USDT remains stable but less attractive in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased demand, as indicated by stablecoin inflows. The market sentiment is highly optimistic, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Significant institutional interest and technical breakout above the upper Bollinger Band signal strong bullish momentum. The news of Ethereum regaining USDT dominance further supports this view.

SOL: +0.6 — Record price highs and potential ETF developments indicate strong investor enthusiasm and institutional focus, suggesting continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, although the price movement is less pronounced compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the relative attractiveness of holding USDT."
2024-11-21 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic factors and strong institutional interest, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand. Ethereum is experiencing significant institutional inflows into ETFs, suggesting strong market confidence. Solana is also seeing increased attention, reaching record highs and attracting institutional interest with a potential ETF. Dogecoin is benefiting from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, adding to its speculative appeal. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but shows no significant bullish signals, as capital rotates towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by pro-crypto regulatory news and record stablecoin inflows, indicating robust demand and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming its position as the leading blockchain for USDT, reflecting strong institutional interest and bullish sentiment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record high and potential ETF filing highlight growing adoption and investor enthusiasm, suggesting continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation support a moderate bullish outlook, though it remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the relative attractiveness of holding USDT."
2024-11-21 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies, driven by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and a surge in stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in Tether issuance. Solana continues to attract attention with record-high prices and potential ETF developments. Dogecoin is experiencing increased interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but shows no significant bullish signals, suggesting a potential capital rotation into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by positive news on regulatory optimism and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating robust demand.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving strong market sentiment, coupled with technical indicators showing bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.6 — Record high prices and potential ETF developments signal strong investor enthusiasm and adoption, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — High-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation are boosting sentiment, despite mixed technical signals.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, holding USDT is less attractive in the current bullish environment."
2024-11-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, bolstered by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, which signal growing demand. Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance and is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching record highs and attracting institutional focus with ETF filings. Dogecoin is seeing renewed interest due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant bullish signals, as investors seem to be rotating capital into more volatile assets amid increasing risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and stablecoin inflows. The potential for regulatory reforms adds to the bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and the reclaiming of USDT dominance provide a strong foundation for continued growth, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.5 — Record highs and institutional interest through ETF filings indicate strong market confidence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — High-profile endorsements and whale accumulation create a positive sentiment, though the asset remains more speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows bullish tendencies, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into higher-yielding assets."
2024-11-21 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting strong demand. Ethereum is gaining traction with institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana has reached a record high, supported by growing adoption and the potential for an ETF, indicating rising institutional focus. Dogecoin is experiencing increased interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with Ethereum reclaiming its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating robust demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and regained USDT dominance provide a bullish outlook, with technical indicators supporting continued strength.

SOL: +0.7 — Record high prices and potential ETF developments suggest strong institutional interest and continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though the technicals are less compelling compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the relative attractiveness of holding USDT."
2024-11-21 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating a strong demand for crypto assets. Ethereum is experiencing robust institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana continues to attract attention with its record-high prices and potential ETF developments, while Dogecoin gains momentum from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. The macroeconomic environment remains supportive, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, encouraging risk-on behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news regarding regulatory optimism and significant stablecoin inflows, which suggest increased demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest and positive news about USDT supply dominance, indicating a favorable environment for further growth.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record-high prices and potential ETF developments highlight growing investor enthusiasm and adoption, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's fundamentals are less robust, high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a moderate bullish signal, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing a strong risk-on sentiment, there is a tendency to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT in favor of more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is approaching the $100K mark, driven by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, which indicate growing demand for crypto assets. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana has reached an all-time high, bolstered by rising adoption and institutional focus, as highlighted by the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is experiencing increased attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with Ethereum regaining dominance in its supply.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong market momentum and positive news regarding potential regulatory reforms. The surge towards $100K and record stablecoin inflows further support a bullish outlook.

**ETH: +0.7** — Ethereum is experiencing robust institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. This positions ETH favorably in the current market environment.

**SOL: +0.6** — Solana's record high and the filing for a Solana ETF highlight strong investor enthusiasm and adoption, suggesting continued upward potential.

**DOGE: +0.3** — While Dogecoin has seen increased attention from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, its speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach compared to other assets.

**USDT: -0.5** — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a lower allocation in USDT is advisable as investors seek higher returns in the crypto market."
2024-11-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing a significant milestone of $100K, fueled by optimism around regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest with substantial ETF inflows and has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana has reached a record high, supported by growing adoption and the potential for a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is experiencing increased attention due to high-profile endorsements and significant accumulation by large holders. In this environment, while the risk appetite is increasing, USDT remains a stable option for those seeking to hedge against volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news on regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest is high with ETF inflows, and Ethereum's dominance in Tether issuance strengthens its position.

SOL: +0.7 — Record high prices and potential ETF developments highlight strong investor enthusiasm and adoption.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-21 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, which indicate growing demand. Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance and is seeing substantial institutional interest through ETF inflows. Solana has hit a record high, fueled by increased adoption and the prospect of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but faces competition from new MiCA-compliant stablecoins in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and stablecoin inflows. The potential for regulatory reforms adds to the bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional interest through ETF inflows and reclaiming USDT dominance are strong bullish indicators, suggesting continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Record high prices and the potential for a Solana ETF indicate strong investor interest and adoption, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — High-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a moderate bullish signal, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards other assets, holding a large USDT position is less attractive in the current bullish environment."
2024-11-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant positive developments across multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, bolstered by optimism around regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating growing demand. Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the top blockchain for USDT supply and is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows. Solana has reached a record high, driven by rising adoption and institutional focus, highlighted by Bitwise's ETF filing. Dogecoin has gained attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with Ethereum regaining dominance for its supply.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by positive news and increased demand, as evidenced by stablecoin inflows. The macroeconomic context supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and Ethereum's regained dominance in USDT supply are positive indicators. The bullish momentum and ETF inflows further strengthen its appeal.

SOL: +0.7 — Record high prices and institutional interest, as shown by the ETF filing, suggest strong growth potential. The positive sentiment and technical indicators support a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — High-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation provide a moderate bullish signal. However, its speculative nature warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, the relative attractiveness of holding USDT decreases."
2024-11-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DEX trading volume highlight its growing role in DeFi, warranting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and ecosystem expansion supports a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns from riskier assets."
2024-11-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana reaching new all-time highs. Bitcoin is nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF investments, while Solana has surpassed Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing influence in the DeFi space. Ethereum has shown strong momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although a large whale sell-off has introduced some volatility. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market rally, suggesting a strategic positioning for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional support and ETF inflows, along with its approach to a new all-time high, make it highly attractive. The technical indicators are generally positive, despite some mixed momentum signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high suggest a positive outlook. The market sentiment is supportive, though slightly cautious.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new all-time high and its increasing dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing market presence and investor confidence, making it a strong candidate for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's price surge, driven by speculation of integration into a major payment system, presents a speculative opportunity. However, the lack of sustained on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings. The recent minting activity suggests preparation for increased liquidity rather than immediate demand."
2024-11-22 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by strong bullish sentiment, particularly for Bitcoin, which has reached a new all-time high near $100,000, driven by institutional inflows and ETF-related optimism. Ethereum is also experiencing significant upward momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend despite some volatility from large sell-offs. Solana is gaining prominence in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume and reaching its own all-time high. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's payment systems. Meanwhile, Tether continues to mint significant amounts of USDT, aligning with the broader bullish trend as liquidity increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news provide a robust bullish backdrop, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility from whale activity, Ethereum's breakout and momentum indicate a positive outlook, though slightly tempered compared to Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DeFi activity position it well for continued growth, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration into payment systems and recent acquisitions support a moderate positive outlook, though with less certainty than other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the strong bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capture potential gains."
2024-11-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and positive ETF news. Ethereum is also experiencing upward momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend despite some volatility from large whale sell-offs. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, highlighting its growing influence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has seen a significant price increase due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, boosting its market appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's increased minting activity aligns with the broader market rally, indicating a demand for liquidity amid rising prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and nearing an all-time high, suggests further capital allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and substantial daily gains indicate a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume reflect strong investor confidence and potential for further growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market rallying, there is a shift towards riskier assets, suggesting a reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-11-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100K, bolstered by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to large whale sell-offs but has shown strong momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing influence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation about its integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests increased demand for liquidity amid the Bitcoin rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong institutional support provide a robust bullish outlook. The ETF inflows further enhance its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for new highs warrant a moderately positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence and justify increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a slight positive bias, although the overall impact remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100,000 mark, buoyed by strong ETF inflows and institutional interest. Ethereum has shown resilience with a recent breakout from a downtrend, although some volatility was introduced by a large whale sell-off. Solana continues to gain traction, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, and reaching new all-time highs. Dogecoin has experienced a boost from speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market rally, suggesting increased liquidity demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news support a bullish outlook. The technical trend signals remain positive, despite some mixed momentum indicators.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent whale sell-off volatility, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news support a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing prominence and investor confidence, justifying a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a moderate buy signal, although the technicals are less compelling compared to others.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's bullish sentiment, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news. Ethereum is also experiencing positive momentum, breaking out of a downtrend despite some volatility from a large whale sell-off. Solana is gaining traction, hitting new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong growth in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has seen a boost from speculative news around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's significant minting activity suggests increased demand for liquidity amid the Bitcoin rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by institutional inflows and ETF-related news. The market is optimistic, and BTC's proximity to the $100,000 milestone suggests further potential upside.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and recent gains indicate positive momentum. The potential for new all-time highs adds to its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence in the DeFi space, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative news around potential integration into a major payment system and recent acquisitions in the DOGE ecosystem provide a positive sentiment boost, though the overall impact remains moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish sentiment and capital rotating into riskier assets, maintaining a high USDT position is less attractive. However, significant minting suggests ongoing demand for liquidity, warranting a moderate reduction rather than a full exit."
2024-11-22 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100,000, bolstered by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off but maintains upward momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume and hitting new all-time highs. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's increased minting activity aligns with the overall bullish sentiment, supporting liquidity needs during Bitcoin's rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong institutional inflows indicate robust upward momentum. The ETF-related news further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its growing dominance in DeFi trading volume highlight its increasing market strength and investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions in the DOGE ecosystem provide a modestly positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market's bullish sentiment, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-22 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100,000 mark, bolstered by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off, but the recent breakout from a downtrend suggests potential for further gains. Solana has reached a new all-time high and is gaining traction in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether's recent minting activity aligns with the broader crypto rally, indicating increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with institutional inflows and ETF-related news, making it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for new highs warrant a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DeFi prominence make it an attractive asset, deserving of a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system provides a slight bullish signal, though the overall impact is moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high near $100,000, driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF activity. Ethereum is showing volatility due to a large whale sell-off but has recently broken out of a downtrend, suggesting potential for further gains. Solana continues to gain prominence, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume and reaching a new all-time high. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation about integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market rally, indicating increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and substantial ETF inflows suggest strong bullish momentum. Institutional interest and positive news support further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-off volatility, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for new highs provide a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing DeFi influence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into Musk's payment system and portfolio acquisition news provide a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's bullish sentiment, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT, as investors seek higher returns from other crypto assets."
2024-11-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, nearing the $100,000 mark, supported by strong ETF inflows and optimism post-U.S. elections. Ethereum has shown strong momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although recent whale activity has introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating growing confidence in its DeFi capabilities. Dogecoin has experienced a price spike due to speculation about potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are highly supportive, with price momentum nearing a significant milestone. This warrants increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive momentum suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing market position, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest from potential integration into X's payment system provides a moderate positive outlook, but with caution due to its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish sentiment and capital moving towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-11-22 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark due to strong institutional inflows and ETF-related optimism. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a significant whale sell-off, but it has shown signs of breaking out of a prolonged downtrend. Solana has reached a new all-time high and is gaining prominence in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether continues to mint large amounts of USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's price rally. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, suggesting a favorable environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news support a bullish outlook. The recent price surge and all-time high signal strong market confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-off volatility, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news on price gains suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DeFi activity indicate strong momentum and investor confidence, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: +0.5 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a positive outlook, despite its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets to capture potential gains."
2024-11-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, nearing the $100,000 mark, supported by strong institutional inflows and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum has shown strong momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend and experiencing substantial gains, although recent whale activity has introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing influence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has experienced a boost from speculative news regarding potential integration into Elon Musk's payment systems. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong institutional interest, along with ETF inflows, indicate robust bullish momentum. This positions BTC as a key asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains suggest a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its rise in DEX trading volume highlight its growing market presence, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest from Elon Musk's potential integration and strategic acquisitions in the ecosystem provide a moderate bullish signal, suggesting a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing strong bullish trends across major cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets is advisable."
2024-11-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF-related optimism. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to significant whale activity but shows potential for upward momentum after breaking out of a downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative news related to potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, though its price remains volatile. Tether's increased minting activity aligns with the bullish sentiment in the crypto market, supporting liquidity needs as other assets rise.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are highly supportive, with the asset nearing a significant psychological milestone of $100,000.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from whale activity, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for new highs suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing appeal, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest from potential integration into X's payment system provides a short-term boost, though the asset remains volatile.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on bullish market conditions."
2024-11-22 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing a significant milestone of $100,000, driven by institutional inflows and ETF-related enthusiasm. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off despite recent gains. Solana has shown strength, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative interest tied to potential integration into Elon Musk's payment system, while Tether's recent minting activity aligns with the broader crypto rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional support and ETF inflows are driving it towards a new all-time high, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new high warrant a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, supporting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest from potential integration into Elon Musk's payment system provides a slight positive bias, though caution is advised due to its volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases with bullish trends in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of higher-yielding opportunities is advisable."
2024-11-22 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and positive ETF news. Ethereum has shown significant price gains, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although recent whale activity has introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, highlighting its growing role in the DeFi space. Dogecoin has experienced a price surge due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's significant minting activity aligns with the broader crypto rally, indicating increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news, coupled with its approach to a new all-time high, suggest a continued bullish trend. The market data supports upward momentum despite some mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent whale sell-offs introducing volatility, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant price gains indicate a positive outlook. The potential for reaching new highs adds to its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume reflect strong market confidence and growing DeFi prominence, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's price increase, driven by speculation around integration into X's payment system, suggests potential for further gains. However, the speculative nature of the news warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market sentiment leans bullish, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for holding large stablecoin reserves."
2024-11-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 milestone, fueled by significant institutional inflows and ETF investments. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off, despite breaking out of a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction with a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative news about potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, leading to a price spike. Meanwhile, Tether's substantial minting activity suggests increased demand for liquidity amid the Bitcoin rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, coupled with its approach to a new all-time high, suggest continued bullish momentum. This makes it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite some volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's recent breakout from a downtrend and positive news indicate potential for further gains, though with some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence in DeFi, making it an attractive asset for increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Speculative interest from potential integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions in the DOGE ecosystem support a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-22 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark and significant institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing positive momentum, with Ethereum breaking out of a downtrend and Solana achieving a new all-time high. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether continues to mint USDT, aligning with the broader crypto rally, indicating strong demand for liquidity. The macroeconomic environment remains supportive, with moderate volatility and a stable U.S. Dollar Index.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and nearing a psychological milestone, suggests continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news indicate potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence and investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system provides a bullish catalyst, though the overall sentiment is less strong than other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, holding a high USDT balance is less attractive."
2024-11-23 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, however, faces resistance at $3.4K and a drop in futures open interest, indicating a potential short-term pullback. Solana is experiencing strong bullish momentum, having hit an all-time high with projections for further gains. Dogecoin has seen a significant price surge driven by memecoin interest, with technicals suggesting potential for further rally. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet market demand, indicating a stable environment for USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, with a high probability of surpassing $100K soon.

ETH: 0.0 — Facing resistance and reduced trading activity, suggesting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and bullish projections support further gains, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and bullish technicals suggest continued upward potential, though with inherent volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted."
2024-11-23 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and strong market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum faces resistance at $3.4K, with reduced trading activity suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum, having recently hit an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has seen a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting potential for further upside. Tether continues to see high demand, with substantial minting activity to meet liquidity needs.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment. The likelihood of surpassing $100K by year-end makes BTC highly attractive.

ETH: -0.3 — Facing resistance and reduced open interest, indicating potential short-term weakness. Current technicals do not support aggressive buying.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and positive analyst projections suggest continued bullish momentum. Strong demand and adoption are supportive.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant recent price surge and potential for further upside based on technicals. Renewed interest in memecoins adds to attractiveness.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-23 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-23 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, driven by strong ETF inflows and renewed interest in memecoins, respectively. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, supported by significant ETF demand and positive market sentiment, with analysts predicting a high probability of surpassing this milestone by year-end. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, with reduced open interest suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets due to strong demand and adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge, with technical indicators suggesting the potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet market demand, indicating robust liquidity conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF demand and positive sentiment. High probability of surpassing $100K supports increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Facing resistance and reduced open interest suggest a potential pullback. Hold current position until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Reached an all-time high with bullish momentum and increased adoption. Positive outlook warrants a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price surge and bullish technicals support further gains. Increased interest in memecoins justifies a higher allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Bullish sentiment across other assets suggests a rotation out of stablecoins. Reduce exposure to free up capital for more promising opportunities."
2024-11-23 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-23 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana, driven by significant news and technical indicators. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, suggesting a high probability of further gains. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets due to strong demand and adoption. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3,400, shows bullish momentum but with reduced trading activity, indicating potential short-term consolidation. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price surge, fueled by renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet rising demand, indicating a stable yet slightly bullish environment for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF demand and positive market sentiment, with a high probability of surpassing $100K soon.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, ETH maintains bullish momentum. However, reduced open interest suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.7 — Reaching an all-time high with strong demand and bullish momentum, supported by raised price targets.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge with potential for further gains, driven by high volume and positive technical indicators.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-23 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, however, faces resistance at $3.4K, with declining open interest suggesting reduced trading activity. Solana continues to show bullish momentum, reaching an all-time high and with projections for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals indicating potential for further upside. Tether has increased its supply to meet rising demand, indicating a stable liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, suggests further gains are likely, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite facing resistance and reduced trading activity, Ethereum's long-term potential remains intact, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bullish momentum and recent all-time high, coupled with positive analyst projections, make it an attractive asset for increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent surge and potential for further upside justify a moderate positive allocation, though caution is advised due to its volatile nature.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-23 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows mixed signals with reduced open interest suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana continues its strong performance, hitting an all-time high and receiving upward price target revisions due to rising adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a substantial surge, fueled by renewed interest in memecoins, and technicals suggest further potential upside. Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand for liquidity, although the stablecoin's role as a safe haven may be less attractive in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive sentiment about reaching $100K. Current holdings should be increased to capitalize on potential gains.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's overall trend remains positive. However, caution is warranted due to reduced open interest, suggesting a more conservative increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's all-time high and positive analyst outlook make it an attractive option for increased allocation, supported by strong demand and bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and technical indicators suggest further upside potential. A moderate increase in allocation is justified to capture potential gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital should be rotated out of stablecoins like USDT to take advantage of growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-11-23 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, with a decline in futures open interest indicating potential short-term weakness. Solana continues its upward trajectory, reaching an all-time high and receiving increased price targets from analysts. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge, driven by renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting further potential gains. Tether has increased its issuance to meet rising demand, indicating a robust liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum fueled by ETF inflows and positive sentiment, with a high probability of reaching $100K, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, the overall bullish market environment and Ethereum's strong fundamentals warrant a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued bullish momentum and reaching an all-time high, along with positive analyst projections, support a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge and potential for further gains due to memecoin interest and technical indicators, justifying a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-11-23 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of a potential pullback due to reduced trading activity. Solana continues its bullish trend, reaching an all-time high with expectations of further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, with technicals suggesting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether has increased its supply to meet rising demand, indicating a healthy liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF inflows and positive sentiment for surpassing $100K. The macro environment supports further gains.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $3.4K, the overall market sentiment remains positive. However, reduced open interest suggests caution.

SOL: +0.6 — All-time high and bullish momentum with a raised price target indicate strong demand and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent surge and technical indicators suggest potential for further rally, but volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.5 — Capital rotation into riskier assets as market sentiment turns bullish, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-23 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows mixed signals with a drop in futures open interest, indicating potential short-term caution. Solana continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, reaching an all-time high and with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge in price due to renewed interest, with technical indicators suggesting the potential for further gains. Tether has been actively minting USDT to meet rising demand, indicating robust liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF demand and positive sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's price is above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating potential for a breakout, though caution is warranted due to reduced open interest.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong demand and bullish momentum with an all-time high and positive price target revisions suggest further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and technical indicators suggest potential for further gains, though the memecoin nature warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin nature, maintain a neutral stance as market conditions favor risk assets."
2024-11-23 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, suggesting a potential for further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of reduced trading activity, indicating a possible short-term pullback. Solana continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, having reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, although recent price decreases suggest volatility. Tether's issuance of new USDT indicates strong demand for liquidity, reflecting a stable market environment for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment suggest further upside potential, making BTC a favorable asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance and reduced trading activity, ETH maintains a bullish trend, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and bullish projections support continued investment in SOL, with strong demand driving momentum.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent volatility and mixed signals suggest a cautious approach, but potential for further gains exists if momentum continues.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is appropriate."
2024-11-23 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by ETF demand and positive market sentiment, suggesting a strong likelihood of surpassing this milestone by year-end. Ethereum faces resistance at $3.4K, with a decline in futures open interest indicating potential short-term pullbacks. Solana continues its bullish momentum, hitting an all-time high and receiving upward price target revisions. Dogecoin has seen a significant price jump due to renewed interest, with technicals suggesting further potential gains. Tether has increased its supply to meet rising market demand, indicating strong liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF-related demand and positive market sentiment support further gains, with a high probability of surpassing $100K.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite resistance at $3.4K and reduced open interest, the overall market remains supportive, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and bullish momentum, along with a raised price target, suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase and potential for further gains based on technical analysis, but volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-23 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by ETF inflows and strong market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3,400, with reduced futures activity suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains due to rising adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, with technicals suggesting the potential for further upside. Tether has increased its supply to meet rising demand, indicating a strong appetite for liquidity in the market. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, which supports a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment. The likelihood of surpassing $100K by year-end supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.1 — Facing resistance at $3,400 with reduced futures activity, but overall bullish momentum and technical indicators remain positive.

SOL: +0.6 — Reached an all-time high with strong demand and bullish momentum. Analysts' price target increase supports further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent surge and technical indicators suggest potential for further upside, but caution is warranted due to high volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — Increased supply and strong demand for liquidity suggest capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment suggesting a high likelihood of surpassing this milestone by year-end. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3,400, with reduced open interest indicating potential short-term consolidation. Solana has reached an all-time high, buoyed by strong demand and bullish forecasts, while Dogecoin has experienced a significant price jump due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting further potential gains. Tether has increased its supply to meet rising market demand, indicating robust liquidity in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment about reaching $100K provide a bullish outlook. Despite technical indicators not signaling a buy, the macro news supports maintaining a strong position.

ETH: 0.0 — While Ethereum is struggling to break resistance at $3,400, the reduced open interest suggests a lack of momentum. A neutral stance is appropriate until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's all-time high and bullish price target suggest continued upward momentum. Strong demand and rising adoption support a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further gains warrant a modest positive allocation. However, the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-23 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by ETF demand and positive market sentiment, suggesting a potential breakthrough. Ethereum, however, is facing resistance at $3.4K, indicating a possible short-term pullback, compounded by a drop in futures open interest. Solana continues to show strong bullish momentum, hitting an all-time high and receiving upward price target revisions. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price surge due to renewed interest, with technicals indicating potential further gains. Meanwhile, Tether has increased its supply to meet market demand, reflecting a stable liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive sentiment, with a high probability of surpassing $100K.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish signals, resistance at $3.4K and reduced trading activity suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and recent all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further gains, but high volatility warrants a moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shows signs of bullishness, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-23 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Analysts are bullish on BTC, predicting a high probability of surpassing $100K by year-end. Ethereum faces resistance at $3,400 and a drop in futures open interest, suggesting potential short-term consolidation. Solana continues its bullish trajectory, hitting an all-time high with further gains anticipated. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed memecoin interest, with technicals pointing to further potential gains. Tether's recent minting of USDT indicates rising demand for liquidity, although this is typical behavior for a stablecoin in volatile markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and ETF-related news support a bullish outlook. The potential for BTC to surpass $100K provides a compelling case for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a bullish trend signal, ETH faces resistance at $3,400 and reduced open interest, suggesting a neutral stance until clearer momentum emerges.

SOL: +0.5 — With SOL reaching an all-time high and analysts raising price targets, the asset shows strong bullish momentum, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and technical predictions of further gains justify a moderate increase in allocation, though caution is advised due to volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With rising risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-23 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly. This indicates some profit-taking and reassessment among traders. Ethereum has seen a significant surge, driven by increased staking activity and a 40% rise in November, suggesting strong investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, holding key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced volatility, with a recent drop followed by a surge in derivatives demand, indicating speculative interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with significant new issuance and potential ventures to offer Bitcoin-backed loans.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and strong market interest suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by increased staking and significant price gains in November make Ethereum an attractive asset in the current market.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment and technical support at key levels, coupled with bullish market forecasts, suggest continued upward potential for Solana.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop, despite speculative interest, warrant a cautious approach to Dogecoin, especially given current holdings.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT issuance supports market liquidity, the current market environment suggests maintaining a neutral stance, with no immediate need for increased stablecoin exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and reassessment among traders. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with recent gains reversing, but strong speculative interest remains as indicated by high open interest. Tether's issuance continues to support market liquidity, with new minting and potential ventures indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and high on-chain activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains, though caution is warranted.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong monthly performance and increased staking activity reflect positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, supporting a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and maintain upward momentum indicates a favorable outlook, with potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop suggest caution, although strong speculative interest remains; a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin demand remains high, supporting market liquidity, but no immediate need to adjust exposure given current market conditions."
2024-11-24 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence, reflected in increased staking and a notable 40% rise in November. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, faces volatility with a recent drop, despite high speculative interest as indicated by record open interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuance, although its role as a safe haven may be less appealing if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and bullish on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains. However, market hesitation warrants a moderate score.

ETH: +0.7 — Strong staking inflows and significant price appreciation in November indicate robust investor confidence and potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels, along with potential for a breakout, make Solana an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price drop and volatility, despite high speculative interest, suggest caution. Given current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — As market conditions lean towards optimism, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets may be beneficial, though maintaining some USDT for liquidity is advisable."
2024-11-24 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum continues to show strength, with significant staking inflows and a notable 40% increase in November, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and showing potential for further upward movement. Dogecoin, despite recent volatility and a significant drop, shows strong speculative interest with record open interest levels. Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, but its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive position in the current environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — While BTC has pulled back slightly, the approach towards $100K and increased on-chain activity suggest continued interest. However, caution is warranted due to recent profit-taking.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, making ETH particularly attractive.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and the defense of key support levels suggest potential for further gains, supported by positive market forecasts.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite high speculative interest, recent volatility and a significant price drop warrant a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased market liquidity and a potential shift towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential market gains."
2024-11-24 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels indicate potential for upward movement, supported by positive market forecasts targeting higher price levels.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark but facing resistance and profit-taking, indicating a cautious optimism. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish momentum, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin experiences volatility with a notable price drop, yet speculative interest remains high. Tether's issuance continues to support market liquidity, with significant new minting and potential large-scale Bitcoin-backed loan ventures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100,000 mark and bullish momentum signal a moderate buy opportunity, though profit-taking suggests caution.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong staking inflows and a significant monthly price increase indicate robust investor confidence and potential for continued gains.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and technical support at key levels suggest potential for upward movement, though recent price action is mixed.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price volatility and a significant drop warrant caution, though high speculative interest may support a rebound.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin issuance supports liquidity, but no strong signals for capital rotation into or out of USDT at this time."
2024-11-24 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the psychological $100,000 mark, although profit-taking has led to a slight pullback. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a significant price increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, indicating investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, holding key support levels and potentially targeting higher price points. Dogecoin, however, has experienced increased volatility and a notable price drop, despite high speculative interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with significant new issuance and strategic partnerships in the works.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and bullish momentum signals suggest continued potential for gains. However, profit-taking indicates a need for cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity reflect investor confidence and reduced supply, making ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and maintain bullish sentiment supports a positive outlook, though the momentum is slightly tempered by recent price stability.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price drop and increased volatility suggest caution, warranting a reduction in exposure despite high speculative interest.

USDT: 0.0 — With market liquidity supported by new issuance, USDT remains a neutral hold as risk appetite in other assets increases."
2024-11-24 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating a potential pause in its rally. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a notable 40% rise in November, suggesting a bullish outlook. Solana is maintaining key support levels and is poised for a potential breakout, reflecting continued bullish sentiment. Dogecoin, on the other hand, has experienced a sharp decline, highlighting its volatility and speculative nature. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, but the macroeconomic environment remains stable with low volatility in traditional markets, suggesting a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's strong momentum and nearing of the $100,000 mark indicate continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's robust staking activity and significant price increase in November reflect strong market confidence and reduced supply, supporting a bullish stance.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's defense of key support levels and bullish sentiment suggest potential for upward movement, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent volatility and price drop indicate caution, but strong speculative interest could lead to quick reversals. Current holdings justify a slight reduction.

USDT: 0.0 — With stable macroeconomic indicators and ongoing market liquidity support, maintaining current USDT levels is prudent to balance risk exposure."
2024-11-24 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 milestone before experiencing a pullback as traders took profits. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, indicating investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, with key support levels being defended and forecasts suggesting further upward movement. Dogecoin has faced significant volatility, with a recent 12% drop, though speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance and potential involvement in a Bitcoin-backed loan venture.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin maintains a strong buy signal with bullish momentum and significant on-chain activity. The overall sentiment remains positive, with potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong November performance and increased staking activity suggest continued upward potential. The market's confidence in ETH is reflected in its recent price surge.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels indicate potential for further gains. The asset remains attractive within the current market context.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop suggest caution. While speculative interest is high, the lack of bullish signals warrants a reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing signs of optimism and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a slightly reduced exposure to USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, defending key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, faces volatility with a significant price drop, despite high speculative interest as indicated by record open interest. Tether's issuance continues to support market liquidity, with significant new minting and potential for large-scale Bitcoin-backed loans.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent pullback, Bitcoin's upward momentum and on-chain activity remain strong, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and reduced supply, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent volatility and significant price drop warrant caution, despite high speculative interest.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin remains a neutral hold as market conditions do not strongly favor risk-on or risk-off positioning at this time."
2024-11-24 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market reassessment. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a notable price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and eyeing further upward movement. Dogecoin has experienced a sharp decline, highlighting its volatility, though speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuance, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst these market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's overall trend remains positive with bullish momentum signals. The approach towards $100K suggests potential for further gains, though caution is warranted.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's increased staking and strong November performance are positive indicators, but recent technical signals suggest some caution is needed.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and maintain bullish sentiment supports a positive outlook, with potential for further gains.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and volatility suggest reducing exposure, though high speculative interest could lead to future opportunities.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintaining a neutral stance on USDT as it continues to provide liquidity in the market, balancing risk management with potential capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-24 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a recent 12% drop, yet strong speculative interest remains. Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuances, indicating a stable demand for stablecoins amidst the current market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's overall trend remains positive with bullish momentum signals. However, the market hesitation suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong performance in November and increased staking activity signal positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, making ETH attractive for allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment persists with SOL holding key support levels and potential for further gains, supported by positive market forecasts.

DOGE: -0.2 — Significant recent volatility and a lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure to DOGE, despite strong speculative interest.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin demand remains strong with new issuances supporting liquidity, but no significant changes in market conditions warranting a shift in allocation."
2024-11-24 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious yet mixed, with Bitcoin recently approaching the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining key support levels, with bullish sentiment persisting, while Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility with a recent drop but high speculative interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with substantial new issuance. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by stable interest rates and low volatility in traditional markets, suggests a neutral backdrop for crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and stable on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to profit-taking signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive investor sentiment and reduced circulating supply, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's defense of key support levels and continued bullish sentiment suggest potential for upward movement, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and significant price drop, coupled with speculative interest, indicate caution. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is advisable.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in allocation. Its role in providing liquidity is crucial, but no immediate changes are needed given the current market conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals. Bitcoin recently approached the $100,000 mark but pulled back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin experienced a sharp decline, reflecting high volatility and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuance, indicating a stable demand for USDT amidst uncertain market conditions. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite nearing $100K, BTC's retreat and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and recent price surge indicate positive sentiment and potential for further gains. Consider increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment and support at $240 suggest potential for upward movement. Maintain a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.5 — Recent volatility and significant price drop warrant a reduction in exposure to manage risk.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the market's cautious sentiment and USDT's role in providing liquidity, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent."
2024-11-24 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with signs of recent bullish momentum stalling across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin approached the $100,000 mark but has since pulled back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has seen significant gains in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its support levels with bullish sentiment, while Dogecoin has experienced a significant drop in price, although speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance and potential strategic partnerships.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite nearing $100K, BTC's recent pullback and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Current market hesitation warrants reducing exposure slightly.

**ETH: +0.3** — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment, though technicals are not yet fully supportive of a strong buy.

**SOL: +0.2** — Maintaining key support levels with bullish sentiment, but lacking clear technical buy signals. Moderate increase in allocation is justified.

**DOGE: -0.5** — Significant price drop and low on-chain activity signal a need to reduce exposure, despite high speculative interest.

**USDT: +0.3** — With market volatility and profit-taking in major cryptos, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent to manage risk and capitalize on future opportunities."
2024-11-24 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, although it has recently pulled back due to profit-taking and market reassessment. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking activity and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and targeting further upward movement. Dogecoin, despite recent volatility and a price drop, sees strong speculative interest as indicated by record open interest in derivatives. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with significant new issuance and potential large-scale BTC-backed loan ventures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin remains near a significant psychological level, and on-chain activity shows a surge, suggesting potential for further gains if market conditions stabilize.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a substantial price increase in November indicate positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, supporting a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and maintain bullish sentiment suggests potential for further price appreciation, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop offset by strong speculative interest in derivatives, resulting in a neutral stance as the market seeks direction.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified, though it remains a critical component for liquidity."
2024-11-24 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark but facing resistance as traders take profits, indicating a potential pause in its recent rally. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a recent drop in price but high speculative interest as indicated by record open interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with substantial new issuance, while also exploring innovative financial ventures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite nearing $100K, BTC's rally momentum has stalled, and profit-taking suggests caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong performance and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment and reduced supply, making ETH relatively attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment persists with support holding, and potential for a breakout suggests a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price drop and high volatility warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

USDT: +0.6 — With mixed market conditions and potential profit-taking in other assets, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, defending key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin experiences high volatility with a recent drop, yet speculative interest remains strong. Tether continues to support market liquidity with significant new issuance, indicating robust demand for stablecoins amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, BTC's approach to the $100,000 mark and strong on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to market hesitation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a substantial price increase in November reflect solid investor confidence, making ETH an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels, coupled with positive market forecasts, make SOL a compelling choice for increased exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price volatility and significant drop, despite high speculative interest, suggest a cautious approach to DOGE, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT issuance supports market liquidity, the current market conditions do not strongly favor a shift towards or away from stablecoins, justifying a neutral stance."
2024-11-24 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin's recent approach towards the $100,000 mark indicates strong interest, but the rally has stalled, reflecting market hesitation. Ethereum shows robust investor confidence, evidenced by increased staking and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains a bullish sentiment with strong support levels and potential for further gains. Dogecoin experiences high volatility with a recent drop in price, yet speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with significant new issuance, supporting broader market activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K highlights strong interest. However, the lack of clear bullish technical signals suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate positive sentiment and reduced supply, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and key support levels suggest potential for further gains, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and recent price drop offset by strong speculative interest, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased market liquidity and a cautious shift towards riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-11-24 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana continues to hold key support levels, with bullish sentiment persisting as it targets higher price levels. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a recent drop in price despite a surge in derivatives demand, indicating speculative interest. Tether's issuance has increased, enhancing market liquidity, which could support further market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100,000 and high on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, albeit with caution due to profit-taking.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, making ETH attractive for allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and technical support at $240, combined with forecasts for further upward movement, make Solana a strong candidate for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent price volatility and speculative interest create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased market liquidity and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on bullish opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-24 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before a slight pullback, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum continues to show strength with increased staking and a significant price surge in November, reflecting investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish momentum, defending key support levels and aiming for higher targets. Dogecoin experienced a recent drop in price, but strong speculative interest remains evident through high open interest in derivatives. Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, with ongoing developments in Bitcoin-backed loan ventures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and bullish on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November highlight investor confidence and reduced supply, supporting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels indicate potential for further gains, justifying a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent price volatility and speculative interest balance each other out, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased market liquidity and risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to allocate more capital to other assets."
2024-11-24 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark but facing resistance as traders take profits. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a notable price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish momentum, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin experiences volatility with a recent price drop, yet high open interest indicates strong speculative activity. Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuance, while also exploring new ventures in Bitcoin-backed loans.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, BTC's approach to $100,000 and positive on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence, supporting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and technical support at key levels suggest potential for further price appreciation, justifying a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent volatility and price drop offset by high speculative interest, leading to a neutral stance as the market seeks direction.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased market liquidity and risk appetite, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is appropriate to allocate more capital to growth assets."
