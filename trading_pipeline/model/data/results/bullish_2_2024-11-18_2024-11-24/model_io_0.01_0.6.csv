2024-11-18 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of potential upward momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase, and technical indicators suggest room for further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with potential for a breakout, although increased exchange balances indicate some accumulation. Solana is benefiting from both network strength and ETF speculation, pushing it to multi-year highs. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance points to rising demand for liquidity, though the stablecoin's role may diminish if risk appetite grows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest further gains, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching resistance with potential for a breakout, though accumulation on exchanges warrants caution.

SOL: +0.7 — Network strength and ETF speculation are driving positive sentiment and price action.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns indicate potential for a rally, but volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment turns more bullish, capital rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets is likely."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with notable upward momentum in several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to show strong uptrend signals, bolstered by significant institutional purchases like MicroStrategy's recent acquisition. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, with potential for a breakout. Solana has been experiencing a surge driven by network strength and speculation around a potential ETF, reaching a 3-year high. Dogecoin is also seeing positive sentiment, with community-driven events and technical patterns suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance indicates rising demand for liquidity, although the broader market trend suggests a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and technical uptrend, coupled with positive news, suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout, and accumulation signals are positive.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong price momentum and positive sentiment from ETF speculation support further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns indicate potential for a rally, though less certain than other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-18 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of potential bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by significant institutional purchases and a robust technical uptrend. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, with potential for a breakout, although rising exchange reserves suggest mixed signals. Solana is benefiting from strong network performance and speculative interest in a potential ETF, driving its price to a multi-year high. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a possible rally. Meanwhile, Tether's new issuance indicates rising demand for liquidity, although it remains a stable asset in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest further gains, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout, though rising reserves warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment and ETF speculation are driving price gains, supported by strong network fundamentals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns hint at a potential rally, but with moderate confidence.

USDT: -0.3 — As market conditions appear bullish, capital rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets is preferred."
2024-11-18 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into the crypto space. Bitcoin's recent large purchase by MicroStrategy and its continued uptrend suggest strong institutional confidence and potential for further gains. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with increasing reserves indicating accumulation. Solana is experiencing significant bullish sentiment, driven by network strength and ETF speculation, reaching a 3-year high. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for liquidity, aligning with a stable macro backdrop.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The large purchase by MicroStrategy and ongoing uptrend suggest strong institutional support and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with signs of accumulation; potential breakout could lead to a bullish wave.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong price performance and ETF speculation are driving bullish sentiment, supported by network strength.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though the recent price increase warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment across other assets, there is a reduced need to hold stablecoins, suggesting capital rotation into riskier assets."
2024-11-18 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is broadly positive, with bullish momentum observed across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by significant institutional investment from MicroStrategy, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. Ethereum is on the verge of a potential breakout, supported by increased reserves and reduced network fees, indicating accumulation.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly positive, with bullish momentum observed across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin remains in a strong uptrend, bolstered by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's large purchase. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level, with potential for a breakout, while Solana continues to benefit from strong network fundamentals and ETF speculation. Dogecoin has seen increased community activity and technical patterns suggest a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting indicates rising demand for stablecoins, although overall market conditions suggest a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin's strong uptrend and significant institutional purchases provide a solid foundation for further gains. The positive technical outlook and bullish news support increased allocation.

**ETH: +0.5** — Ethereum is nearing a breakout point, with accumulation signals and reduced fees indicating potential upward movement. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

**SOL: +0.7** — Solana's recent price surge and positive sentiment from ETF speculation suggest continued strength. The asset's strong network activity further supports a bullish stance.

**DOGE: +0.3** — While Dogecoin's community engagement and technical patterns hint at a rally, the asset remains speculative. A moderate increase in allocation is justified by the potential for gains.

**USDT: -0.5** — With the current bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings. Capital rotation into riskier assets is advisable."
2024-11-18 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend suggest continued investor confidence. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, with increased exchange balances indicating potential accumulation. Solana is experiencing a surge, driven by speculation around a potential ETF and strong network performance. Dogecoin is also seeing positive sentiment, with community-driven events and technical patterns suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity points to increased demand for liquidity, though its technical indicators suggest a possible short-term breakdown.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional buying and technical indicators. The macro environment and news suggest continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching key resistance with positive accumulation signals. The potential for a breakout supports a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong price performance and positive sentiment driven by ETF speculation. Technical indicators remain supportive of further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive community sentiment and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though less strong than other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, especially given the bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-18 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its firm uptrend suggest continued investor confidence. Ethereum is approaching a breakout level, supported by increased reserves and reduced fees, indicating potential accumulation. Solana is experiencing heightened interest due to ETF speculation and network strength, reaching a multi-year high. Dogecoin, while celebrating community events, shows potential for a significant rally based on technical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates rising demand for stablecoins, though its technical indicators suggest a neutral stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and significant institutional interest from MicroStrategy support further gains. Positive technicals and news suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Increased reserves and reduced fees indicate accumulation, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong network performance and ETF speculation drive bullish sentiment. Recent price surge to a multi-year high reinforces positive momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community engagement and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though recent price volatility warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish trends, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-11-18 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly positive, with significant bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Bitcoin's strong uptrend is reinforced by MicroStrategy's substantial purchase, indicating institutional confidence. Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout, supported by increased reserves and reduced fees, suggesting accumulation. Solana has reached a 3-year high, driven by network strength and speculation around a potential ETF. Dogecoin is experiencing a community-driven boost, with technical patterns indicating potential for a major rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests increased demand for liquidity, although its price remains stable as expected for a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong uptrend, supported by significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators, suggests further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's approach to a key resistance level and accumulation signals indicate a likely breakout, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's price surge to a multi-year high and positive sentiment from ETF speculation make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin benefits from community enthusiasm and technical patterns hinting at a rally, it remains more speculative compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-18 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with strong upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy and its sustained uptrend indicate robust institutional interest and potential for further gains. Ethereum is on the cusp of a breakout, supported by increasing reserves and decreasing fees, suggesting accumulation. Solana is experiencing a surge due to network strength and ETF speculation, reaching multi-year highs. Dogecoin is buoyed by community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether's new issuance points to rising demand for liquidity, although its role as a stablecoin may see reduced preference in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend signal continued bullish momentum. Positive macroeconomic sentiment supports further capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching key resistance with signs of accumulation and reduced fees, indicating a potential breakout and further upside.

SOL: +0.7 — Significant price increase and ETF speculation drive strong investor interest, suggesting continued upward movement.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns hint at a potential rally, though less pronounced than other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital rotation away from stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in risk assets."
2024-11-18 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals for major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its sustained uptrend suggest strong institutional confidence and potential for further gains. Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout, supported by increased reserves and reduced fees, indicating accumulation. Solana is experiencing significant bullish momentum, driven by network strength and ETF speculation. Dogecoin has seen a recent price dip, but community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance reflects rising demand for liquidity, although it remains a stable asset with no significant price movement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend support a bullish outlook. Positive on-chain activity reinforces confidence in further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees are positive indicators for upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Surging price and positive sentiment driven by ETF speculation and network strength. Recent high suggests continued investor interest.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite recent price drop, community enthusiasm and potential technical rally provide a slightly positive outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — While demand for liquidity is rising, the current market environment favors risk assets over stablecoins, suggesting a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-11-18 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of potential bullish momentum. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its ongoing uptrend suggest strong institutional confidence, while Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout, supported by increasing exchange reserves and decreasing fees. Solana continues to benefit from bullish sentiment and ETF speculation, reaching a three-year high. Dogecoin, while celebrating community events, shows potential for a significant rally according to technical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether's new issuance indicates rising demand for liquidity, though its price dipped slightly below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential short-term volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and ongoing uptrend, coupled with bullish technical indicators, make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout, supported by positive on-chain signals and news of accumulation.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent price surge and ETF speculation provide strong bullish sentiment, making SOL a favorable asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, the current market data is mixed, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With rising risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-18 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Solana showing strong upward momentum supported by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and its firm uptrend suggest continued bullish sentiment. Solana is benefiting from network strength and speculation around a potential ETF, pushing it to multi-year highs. Ethereum is approaching a key resistance level, which could trigger a bullish wave if broken. Dogecoin is experiencing community-driven enthusiasm, but technical patterns suggest potential for a significant rally. Tether's recent minting indicates rising demand for liquidity, although the broader market's risk appetite seems to be increasing, potentially reducing the need for stablecoin holdings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators suggest further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Approaching key resistance with potential for a breakout, though recent accumulation and fee drops indicate mixed sentiment.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong network performance and ETF speculation are driving bullish sentiment, supporting further price gains.

DOGE: 0.2 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, but current data does not strongly support immediate gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and strong performance in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-18 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by strong technical indicators and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a significant uptrend, bolstered by MicroStrategy's large purchase, indicating institutional confidence. Ethereum is on the cusp of a potential breakout, with increasing reserves suggesting accumulation. Solana continues to benefit from network strength and ETF speculation, pushing it to multi-year highs. Dogecoin is seeing renewed interest from community-driven events and technical patterns hinting at a potential rally. Meanwhile, USDT shows stability with increased issuance, reflecting rising demand and liquidity support.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong uptrend and institutional backing provide a solid foundation for further gains. The positive news and technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's approach to a key resistance level and accumulation signals are positive, though slightly tempered by mixed technicals. The potential for a breakout supports a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price surge and ETF speculation create a favorable environment for continued growth. The asset's strong network performance and investor interest justify a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin lacks strong technical signals, community enthusiasm and potential for a rally provide a modestly bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-18 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional investment from MicroStrategy and a firm uptrend in technical indicators. Ethereum is on the verge of a potential breakout, with increasing exchange reserves and decreasing fees suggesting accumulation. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment due to network strength and ETF speculation, driving its price near a 3-year high. Dogecoin has seen increased community activity and bullish technical patterns, although its recent price movements have been volatile. Tether's recent minting activity indicates rising demand and liquidity, but its role as a stablecoin suggests it may be less attractive in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and technical uptrend, along with positive news, suggest further gains are likely.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout; accumulation signals are positive.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and ETF speculation support further gains; recent price surge indicates strong momentum.

DOGE: +0.2 — Community activity and bullish technical patterns suggest potential for gains, but recent volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.3 — In a bullish market environment, capital rotation away from stablecoins is expected as risk appetite increases."
2024-11-18 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly positive, with notable bullish momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy and its strong technical uptrend suggest continued investor confidence and potential for further price appreciation. Ethereum is also showing signs of a breakout, supported by increased exchange reserves and reduced network fees, indicating accumulation. Solana continues to benefit from strong network performance and ETF speculation, driving its price to multi-year highs. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm, but its technical outlook remains mixed despite some bullish analyst projections. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity reflects robust demand for stablecoins, although overall market conditions suggest a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant institutional investment signal a positive outlook. The technical uptrend and MicroStrategy's purchase reinforce confidence in BTC's growth potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching key resistance levels with potential for a breakout. The increase in exchange reserves and lower fees suggest accumulation, supporting a bullish stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued price strength and positive sentiment driven by ETF speculation and network performance. The recent surge to a 3-year high indicates strong investor interest.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite community enthusiasm, technical indicators are mixed. The lack of a clear bullish signal suggests a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.3 — While demand for stablecoins remains, the broader market's bullish sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-11-18 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum supported by strong technical indicators and positive news developments. Bitcoin is benefiting from significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's large purchase, while Ethereum is on the verge of a potential breakout. Solana is experiencing a surge in interest due to speculation around an ETF and strong network performance. Dogecoin has mixed signals, with community-driven enthusiasm but no substantial technical backing. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance indicates a demand for liquidity, although the broader market trend suggests a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend suggest further gains. Positive on-chain activity supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees are positive indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent price surge and ETF speculation are driving interest. Despite a slight pullback, the overall sentiment remains bullish.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite community enthusiasm, there is no clear technical or fundamental catalyst to drive significant movement.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and ETH."
2024-11-18 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is showing signs of bullish momentum, particularly for BTC and ETH, driven by strong technical indicators and positive news. Bitcoin's uptrend is reinforced by significant institutional purchases, while Ethereum is on the verge of a potential breakout. Solana is benefiting from ETF speculation and network strength, although its technical indicators are mixed. Dogecoin is experiencing positive sentiment from community events and technical patterns suggesting a potential rally. Tether's recent minting indicates rising demand for stablecoins, but the overall market sentiment is leaning towards risk-on, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators. The macro environment is conducive to further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees suggest positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.3 — Benefiting from ETF speculation and network strength, but technical indicators are mixed, warranting cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive community sentiment and potential for a rally as indicated by technical patterns, but lacks strong fundamental drivers.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the crypto market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-18 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of potential upward momentum. Bitcoin remains in a strong uptrend, bolstered by significant institutional purchases, such as MicroStrategy's acquisition, and technical indicators suggesting further gains. Ethereum is on the verge of a potential breakout, with increasing exchange reserves and decreasing fees indicating accumulation. Solana has reached a multi-year high, driven by network strength and speculation around a potential ETF, indicating strong investor interest. Dogecoin has seen community-driven enthusiasm and technical patterns suggesting a possible rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates increasing demand for liquidity, although its stable nature makes it less attractive in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional backing and a firm uptrend signal a positive outlook. The recent large purchase by MicroStrategy reinforces confidence in BTC's long-term potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Approaching a key resistance level with signs of accumulation, ETH shows potential for a breakout, supported by bullish momentum indicators.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching a 3-year high and driven by ETF speculation, SOL exhibits strong bullish sentiment and network strength, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though it remains speculative compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment leans towards risk-on, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum supported by positive technical indicators and significant institutional interest. Bitcoin's recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy and Ethereum's potential breakout at key resistance levels suggest a bullish outlook. Solana continues to benefit from strong network performance and ETF speculation, maintaining its upward trajectory. Dogecoin is experiencing community-driven enthusiasm, with technical patterns indicating potential for a significant rally. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests increased demand for liquidity, although the broader market's risk-on sentiment may reduce the relative attractiveness of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional buying and technical uptrend support further gains. Positive news flow reinforces confidence in continued price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching key resistance with potential for breakout. Accumulation signals and reduced fees are supportive of a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Benefiting from network strength and ETF speculation. Recent price performance and sentiment remain positive.

DOGE: +0.3 — Community enthusiasm and technical patterns suggest potential for a rally, though risk remains higher compared to major assets.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans bullish, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-11-18 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong bullish momentum, supported by positive news such as MicroStrategy's large BTC purchase and Ethereum's potential breakout. Solana is also benefiting from positive sentiment and speculation around a potential ETF. Dogecoin has seen some community-driven enthusiasm but lacks significant technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests increased demand for stablecoins, although the overall market sentiment leans towards risk-on, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong uptrend supported by significant institutional buying and positive technical indicators. The macro environment does not present immediate risks to BTC's bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Approaching a key resistance level with potential for a breakout, supported by increasing reserves and declining fees, indicating accumulation.

SOL: +0.5 — Benefiting from bullish sentiment and speculation around an ETF, though technical indicators are currently neutral. The overall positive news flow supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite community-driven enthusiasm, technical indicators do not support a strong buy signal. The potential for a rally exists but lacks immediate evidence.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing a risk-on sentiment, there is a preference to rotate capital into cryptocurrencies rather than holding stablecoins. However, recent minting indicates that demand for liquidity remains."
2024-11-19 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions and potential crypto-friendly policies. Ethereum, however, faces mixed sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to reach previous highs. Solana shows robust ecosystem strength, evidenced by high DEX volumes and a significant market cap. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a bullish breakout. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no impact on customer funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF developments and macroeconomic optimism, suggests further gains. The asset remains attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and recent price volatility warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem strength and high DEX volumes indicate positive momentum, making it an appealing option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rallies and bullish sentiment suggest potential for further gains, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2024-11-19 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high driven by positive macroeconomic developments and hopes for crypto-friendly policies. Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals, faces bearish sentiment from investors, which could limit its upside potential. Solana shows robust ecosystem strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone, indicating strong investor interest. Dogecoin has experienced a recent rally and bullish breakout patterns suggest potential for further gains. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive sentiment from ETF developments support a strong buy signal. The macro environment is also favorable for BTC.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are positive, bearish investor sentiment tempers enthusiasm. The addition of staking to ETH ETP is a positive development.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong ecosystem activity and market cap growth make Solana an attractive option, though technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent rally and bullish breakout patterns suggest potential for further gains, but low on-chain activity warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-19 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism around potential crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment, with strong fundamentals but bearish investor outlook. Solana shows strength with record DEX volumes and a significant market cap milestone, while Dogecoin experiences a notable rally with potential for further gains. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable indices, supports a balanced approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news about ETF developments suggest further upside potential. The recent all-time high and increased on-chain activity reinforce a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite bearish sentiment, Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong, and the introduction of staking rewards could attract more investors. However, caution is warranted due to mixed signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's robust DEX volume and market cap growth indicate strong ecosystem health, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for further gains are promising, but the lack of significant technical or on-chain signals suggests a moderate approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-11-19 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies following recent U.S. election results. Ethereum is facing mixed sentiment, with bearish investor outlook despite strong fundamentals and new staking opportunities. Solana shows robust ecosystem strength, with DEXs hitting record volumes and surpassing major companies in market cap. Dogecoin is experiencing a strong rally, with potential for further gains, while Tether faces some negative news due to a security breach, though it hasn't impacted customer funds. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive policy outlook provide strong bullish momentum, supported by ETF developments.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and recent price decreases suggest a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate positive momentum, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price rally and bullish breakout potential make DOGE attractive for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."
2024-11-19 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals, faces bearish investor sentiment, possibly due to doubts about revisiting its yearly high. Solana shows strength with record DEX volumes and surpassing major companies in market cap, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin is experiencing a bullish breakout, with potential for significant gains, while Tether faces a setback due to a security breach, though it doesn't impact customer funds directly. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500 performance, suggesting a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive news around ETF developments suggest strong upward momentum, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, bearish investor sentiment and doubts about price recovery warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX activity and market cap growth highlight Solana's ecosystem strength, supporting a moderately positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Bullish breakout patterns and recent price surges suggest potential for further gains, justifying increased exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital seems prudent."
2024-11-19 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin's surge past $93.5K is driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies, while Dogecoin's rally is supported by a potential breakout pattern. Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals, faces bearish sentiment, which may limit its upside potential. Solana's ecosystem shows strength with high DEX volumes and a significant market cap, indicating robust user engagement. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a cautiously bullish stance on risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news around ETF developments support a bullish outlook. The recent all-time high suggests continued investor interest.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — High DEX volumes and a strong market cap position Solana as a promising asset in the current market environment. Positive technical signals also support an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish breakout potential and recent price surge indicate strong market interest, justifying a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-11-19 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500 is supported by hopes for crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results, while Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for further gains highlight increased investor interest. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts doubt its ability to revisit yearly highs. Solana's ecosystem strength is evident with record trading volumes on DEXs and a significant market cap increase, surpassing major companies like Nike and Sony. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no customer funds affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators, suggests further gains. The recent all-time high and ETF developments enhance its attractiveness.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a neutral stance. The market appears undecided on ETH's short-term direction.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive news regarding DEX volumes and market cap growth, combined with bullish technical indicators, make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential for significant gains, coupled with bullish momentum signals, justify increased exposure to capitalize on potential upside.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2024-11-19 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high driven by favorable macroeconomic developments and potential crypto-friendly policies. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite its strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubt about its ability to reach previous highs. Solana is showing strength with record trading volumes on its decentralized exchanges and a significant market cap milestone, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, with analysts predicting further gains based on bullish technical patterns. Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach, with no impact on customer funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators, suggests continued bullish potential. The recent all-time high and ETF developments add further confidence.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals warrant caution. The market seems hesitant about ETH's short-term prospects.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive DEX volume and market cap achievements, coupled with bullish technical signals, indicate strong growth potential and justify increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent rally and positive sentiment, along with bullish breakout patterns, suggest potential for further gains, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other cryptocurrencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more promising assets."
2024-11-19 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high, driven by hopes for crypto-friendly policies in the U.S. This optimism is somewhat tempered by bearish sentiment around Ethereum, despite strong fundamentals. Solana is showing robust ecosystem activity with high DEX volumes and a significant market cap, indicating strong investor interest. Dogecoin has seen a recent rally, supported by bullish technical patterns, while Tether has faced some negative news due to a security breach, although it did not affect customer funds. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments and price highs suggest continued bullishness.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest a hold position.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong market cap growth and high DEX volumes indicate robust ecosystem activity, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rally and potential for further gains based on technical patterns justify a moderate positive score.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high and Dogecoin experiencing a notable rally. Bitcoin's price surge is supported by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results, while Dogecoin's rally is driven by a bullish breakout pattern. Solana also shows strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap increase. However, Ethereum faces bearish investor sentiment despite positive developments like staking rewards. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and no drastic changes in major indices, suggesting a conducive environment for risk assets. Tether's recent security breach highlights potential risks, but it hasn't significantly impacted the stablecoin's market position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, all-time high, and supportive news indicate a favorable environment for further gains. The breakout above the upper Bollinger Band reinforces the bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The absence of a buy signal in trend and momentum indicators supports a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's robust DEX activity and market cap growth, coupled with bullish technical signals, make it an attractive asset. Positive news about ecosystem strength further supports this allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and bullish breakout potential, as highlighted by analysts, suggest continued upward momentum. The asset's recent performance justifies increased exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets. The recent security breach also adds a slight negative sentiment."
2024-11-19 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by Bitcoin's recent all-time high and positive developments in the Solana and Dogecoin ecosystems. Bitcoin's surge past $93,500, supported by hopes for crypto-friendly policies, indicates strong investor confidence. Solana's ecosystem strength is highlighted by record DEX volumes and a significant market cap, while Dogecoin shows potential for further gains amid bullish patterns. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite its strong fundamentals, and Tether's recent security breach may raise concerns about stablecoin security. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable oil prices and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about ETF developments support further gains. The recent price surge and on-chain activity indicate continued investor interest.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish sentiment and technical indicators suggest caution. Despite strong fundamentals, the lack of positive momentum and recent price decline warrant a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Record DEX volumes and a strong market cap position Solana as a promising asset. The technical indicators and news suggest continued ecosystem growth.

DOGE: +0.4 — Positive price momentum and bullish news about potential rallies make Dogecoin attractive. However, the recent price decline tempers enthusiasm slightly.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-11-19 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high, driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions and the potential for crypto-friendly policies. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as investors remain skeptical about its ability to revisit yearly highs. Solana continues to demonstrate strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap. Dogecoin has shown impressive performance with a recent rally and potential for further gains, while Tether remains stable despite a recent security breach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about ETF developments support a bullish outlook, making BTC a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest a neutral stance for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Record DEX volumes and strong market cap growth indicate robust ecosystem health, warranting increased exposure to SOL.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent rally and bullish breakout potential suggest moderate upside, but the asset remains volatile.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-19 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions and positive news regarding crypto-friendly policies. Ethereum, however, faces bearish investor sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as reflected in its technical indicators.

Dogecoin has shown notable bullish momentum, supported by both technical indicators and optimistic price forecasts. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, though recent security issues highlight potential vulnerabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators, suggests continued bullish potential. The all-time high and ETF-related developments further enhance its appeal.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite Ethereum's strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and technical indicators suggest caution. The lack of a buy signal and recent price declines warrant a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's robust ecosystem growth and strong technical indicators, including buy signals and bullish momentum, make it an attractive asset for increased capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and bullish breakout pattern, along with positive sentiment, support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capture potential gains in the broader market."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high, buoyed by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to revisit yearly highs. Solana continues to demonstrate ecosystem strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone. Dogecoin has shown notable upward momentum, driven by bullish sentiment and technical patterns suggesting potential further gains. Meanwhile, Tether's recent security breach highlights ongoing concerns about stablecoin security, although no customer funds were affected.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and on-chain activity, suggests further gains. The recent all-time high and ETF developments provide additional bullish sentiment.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of clear technical signals warrant a cautious approach. The market seems less convinced about ETH's short-term prospects.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's robust DEX activity and market cap growth indicate strong ecosystem health. Positive technical signals and news support a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further appreciation. Positive sentiment and technical indicators are supportive.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted. The recent security breach also adds a layer of caution."
2024-11-19 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin's surge to an all-time high above $93.5K, fueled by optimism around crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. This positive sentiment is reflected in the strong upward momentum and buy signals across several assets, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Solana also shows strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone. However, Ethereum faces bearish investor sentiment despite its strong fundamentals and new staking opportunities. Tether remains stable, though a recent security breach highlights potential risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive macroeconomic news create a strong bullish environment. On-chain activity and technical indicators support further upside.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Record DEX volumes and a strong market cap position indicate robust ecosystem growth, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news about potential price rallies make Dogecoin attractive in the current market.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-19 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism around potential crypto-friendly policies. This upward momentum is reflected across several cryptocurrencies, particularly Dogecoin, which has seen a significant price surge and bullish breakout patterns suggesting further gains. Solana also shows strength with record trading volumes on its decentralized exchanges and a market cap surpassing major corporations like Nike and Sony. However, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment despite its strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to reach previous highs. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, although a recent security breach highlights potential vulnerabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news about ETF developments support a bullish outlook. The recent price breakout further reinforces confidence in continued gains.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish investor sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest caution. The market seems to favor other assets currently.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record DEX volumes and strong market cap position indicate robust ecosystem growth, making it an attractive investment in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increases and bullish breakout patterns suggest potential for further gains. Positive sentiment and technical indicators support a favorable outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish trends in other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-19 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by hopes of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, however, faces bearish investor sentiment despite strong fundamentals, indicating potential short-term challenges. Solana shows robust ecosystem strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap milestone. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, with analysts predicting further potential gains. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, though recent security concerns highlight vulnerabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news regarding ETF developments suggest continued bullishness, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals indicate caution, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Record DEX volumes and strong market cap performance support a positive outlook, justifying increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, bullish breakout patterns and positive sentiment provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which has reached an all-time high above $93.5K, driven by optimism around potential crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Bitcoin's strong price momentum is supported by positive technical indicators and a surge in on-chain activity. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts express doubts about its ability to reach previous highs. Solana shows signs of strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, with analysts predicting further potential gains. Tether remains stable, although a recent security breach has raised concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with supportive news and on-chain activity, makes it a highly attractive asset in the current market environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals suggest reducing exposure to Ethereum.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's impressive DEX volume and market cap growth indicate strong ecosystem health, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rally and bullish sentiment provide a positive outlook, though the asset remains volatile.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-11-19 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high amid hopes for crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Despite this, Ethereum faces bearish investor sentiment, though its fundamentals remain strong. Solana continues to show ecosystem strength with record DEX volumes and a high market cap, while Dogecoin has seen recent price rallies and potential for further gains. Tether remains stable, though a recent security breach highlights potential vulnerabilities. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and positive news regarding ETF developments suggest strong momentum and potential for further gains.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite strong fundamentals, bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals warrant caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX activity and market cap growth indicate robust ecosystem health, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rally and bullish breakout potential suggest moderate upside, though technicals are mixed.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish sentiment in other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is expected to capture potential gains."
2024-11-19 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high, driven by expectations of crypto-friendly policies following U.S. election results. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment despite strong fundamentals, as analysts doubt a return to its yearly highs. Solana shows robust ecosystem strength with record trading volumes on its DEXs and a significant market cap, indicating strong user engagement. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, with analysts predicting further gains. Tether faced a security breach, but the impact seems limited to treasury funds, with no customer losses reported.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity, suggests continued bullishness.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite some positive developments like staking rewards, the prevailing bearish sentiment and lack of technical buy signals warrant caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record DEX volumes and strong market cap growth indicate a healthy ecosystem, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price rally and bullish breakout pattern suggest potential for further gains, though the momentum is not as strong as BTC or SOL.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-20 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant developments influencing various assets. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum driven by pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, as evidenced by recent treasury allocations. Ethereum has broken a key psychological level, with potential for further gains, although technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is showing signs of bullish potential with ETF filings and ambitious price targets, but recent price declines suggest caution. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to political connections, though its price remains volatile. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity, but its role as a stablecoin means it may see reduced demand in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news developments, including ETF optimism and institutional adoption, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, breaking the $3,000 level and potential for further gains provide a moderate buy signal, supported by recent ETF developments.

SOL: +0.2 — While recent price declines warrant caution, the potential for an ETF and bullish price targets provide a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative interest and political connections create volatility, but lack of consistent upward momentum suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings in the current market environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable upward movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by positive news and institutional interest. Bitcoin's price surge is supported by pro-crypto political developments and ETF optimism, while Ethereum benefits from breaking key price levels and ETF-related activities. Solana is experiencing bullish sentiment with ETF filings and ambitious price targets, although recent price action shows some volatility. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest, driven by political developments, but lacks strong technical support. Tether remains stable, with significant minting activity indicating anticipation of increased market demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum due to positive news regarding ETF optimism and political support. This, combined with a buy signal from short MA, suggests a favorable environment for BTC.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum shows potential for further gains after breaking $3,000, supported by ETF-related news. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, Solana's bullish news and ETF filing provide a positive outlook. However, technical signals are not yet fully supportive, suggesting cautious optimism.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative interest in Dogecoin due to political news, the lack of strong technical signals and recent price volatility suggest a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent, especially given the recent minting activity indicating market demand for other assets."
2024-11-20 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant macroeconomic and political developments. Bitcoin is nearing the $95K mark, buoyed by pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest. Ethereum has broken past $3K, with potential for further gains. Solana is seeing bullish sentiment with ETF proposals and price predictions suggesting substantial upside. Dogecoin experiences volatility due to political speculation and hype. Tether's recent minting indicates anticipation of increased market demand, suggesting a potential shift in capital allocation preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. The pro-crypto political environment further enhances its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K barrier with potential for further gains, though technical indicators remain mixed. Positive sentiment from ETF developments supports a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment driven by ETF proposals and optimistic price predictions. Despite recent price fluctuations, the overall outlook remains positive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political hype and price swings, the lack of consistent technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent."
2024-11-20 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals' treasury allocation. Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking the $3K mark with potential for further gains, while Solana is buoyed by ETF filings and bullish price targets. Dogecoin has experienced volatility due to political speculation, but lacks strong technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity, indicating a potential shift in capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive sentiment from political developments and institutional interest, combined with a recent price surge, suggests strong upward potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K level and potential for further gains, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from ETF filings and analyst predictions, despite recent price declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — Volatility driven by speculative news, but lacking strong technical or on-chain support for a directional move.

USDT: -0.4 — Potential capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases, supported by recent minting activity."
2024-11-20 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant news events and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin has seen a notable price increase, fueled by positive sentiment from a pro-crypto political environment and institutional interest, such as Acurx Pharmaceuticals adding BTC to its treasury. Ethereum has broken the $3,000 mark, with potential for further gains, supported by ETF developments. Solana is also attracting attention with ETF filings and bullish price predictions. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political speculation and hype. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting of 1 billion USDT suggests anticipation of increased market activity, though its role remains primarily as a stable asset in the current environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin's strong price momentum, driven by positive news and institutional interest, suggests further upside potential. The macroeconomic environment and ETF optimism provide additional support.

**ETH: +0.5** — Ethereum's recent price breakthrough and ETF developments indicate a favorable outlook, although technical indicators remain neutral. The potential for further gains justifies a moderately positive score.

**SOL: +0.6** — Solana's bullish sentiment, driven by ETF filings and optimistic price predictions, supports a positive allocation. Despite neutral technicals, the news-driven momentum is a strong factor.

**DOGE: +0.2** — While Dogecoin is experiencing speculative volatility, the political attention and trading buzz provide a slight positive tilt. However, the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

**USDT: -0.3** — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant news events and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin is nearing $95K, buoyed by positive political developments and institutional interest, suggesting strong bullish sentiment. Ethereum has broken through the $3K mark, with analysts predicting further upward movement. Solana is also experiencing bullish momentum, with ETF filings and price targets suggesting potential gains. Dogecoin has seen speculative interest due to political news, though its price remains volatile. Meanwhile, USDT is stable, with recent minting indicating expected demand. Overall, the market is showing signs of a bullish trend, but with some caution due to mixed macroeconomic indicators such as high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong news catalysts and price momentum suggest further upside potential. Institutional interest and ETF optimism are key drivers.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K level and positive news around ETFs provide a bullish outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from ETF filings and high price targets support an upward bias, despite neutral technical signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest and political news provide a slight bullish tilt, but caution is warranted due to volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — The overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-20 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, which have positively influenced Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing $95K, buoyed by institutional interest and positive news, while Ethereum has broken the $3K mark with potential for further gains. Solana is also showing bullish potential with ETF filings and price predictions suggesting significant upward movement. Dogecoin has experienced volatility due to political and trading buzz, while Tether's recent minting indicates anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with no extreme volatility, suggesting a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. Positive news and price action suggest further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K barrier with potential for further upside. Positive sentiment from ETF developments supports a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from ETF filing and price predictions. Positive news flow supports increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent volatility and political buzz, no clear directional signal emerges. Holding current position.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-20 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing the $95K mark, driven by positive sentiment from Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken past the $3K threshold, with analysts predicting further gains. Solana is also attracting attention with a proposed ETF and bullish price predictions. Dogecoin has seen price volatility due to political speculation, while Tether has minted a significant amount of USDT, indicating anticipated market demand. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, though the high U.S. Dollar Index could temper aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding institutional adoption and ETF optimism suggest continued bullish potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K barrier and positive analyst sentiment provide a favorable outlook, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from ETF proposal and bullish price predictions support a moderately bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.2 — Political speculation has driven recent price increases, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing USDT exposure seems prudent."
2024-11-20 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by positive news and technical indicators for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum due to pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, while Ethereum has broken a key price level, with potential for further gains. Solana is also gaining attention with ETF filings and bullish price predictions, although technical indicators remain neutral. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to political news, but lacks strong technical support. Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity, but stablecoin demand may decrease if risk appetite continues to rise.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by pro-crypto political news and ETF optimism. On-chain activity remains robust, indicating continued interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking through the $3,000 level with bullish momentum signals and positive news about ETF developments. Potential for further upside.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from ETF filings and bullish price predictions, though technical indicators are neutral. Worth a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative interest driven by political news, but lacking strong technical support. Maintain current position without increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment improves, there is a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-20 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward momentum driven by positive news, including ETF optimism and institutional interest, pushing it near $95K. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains as institutional products like ETFs gain traction. Solana is also showing bullish patterns, with a potential ETF filing and price predictions suggesting significant upside. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest driven by political developments, though its technical indicators remain neutral. Tether's recent minting activity suggests anticipation of increased market demand, reflecting a stable backdrop for the stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical and news perspectives, with ETF optimism and institutional interest driving price momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and breaking key price levels, supported by institutional interest and ETF developments.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from ETF filing and price predictions, though technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative interest is high, but technical indicators do not support a strong directional move.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-20 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward momentum, bolstered by positive news such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, pushing prices near $95K. Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with analysts predicting further gains, although technical indicators suggest a mixed short-term outlook. Solana is gaining attention with a potential ETF filing and bullish price targets, although technical signals remain neutral. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political speculation but lacks strong technical support. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests preparation for increased market demand, indicating a potential shift in capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news, including ETF optimism and institutional adoption, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has broken key price levels, mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach. However, the overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite neutral technical indicators, the potential for a SOL ETF and bullish price predictions support a moderately positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political hype and price swings, DOGE lacks strong technical signals or sustained momentum to justify a directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-11-20 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin nearing $95K following Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Ethereum has also shown strength, breaking the $3,000 mark with potential for further gains. Solana is gaining attention with a proposed ETF and bullish price targets, while Dogecoin experiences volatility due to political hype. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a favorable environment for risk assets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains elevated, which could temper some of the bullish sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding ETF optimism and institutional interest. The macro environment supports risk assets, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite slight recent price decreases, ETH has broken key resistance levels and benefits from positive news, including the Grayscale ETF developments.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and news of a potential ETF provide a positive outlook, although technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political hype and recent price swings, technical indicators remain bearish, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-11-20 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's recent price surge and positive technical indicators, along with bullish news, support a favorable outlook. The potential move towards $3,800 adds to the positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is benefiting from ETF-related news and bullish price predictions. Despite the lack of a buy signal from moving averages, the overall sentiment and market activity are supportive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price swings and political news, Dogecoin lacks strong technical signals or sustained momentum to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need to hold stablecoins. Capital rotation into riskier assets is warranted given the current market environment."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic developments and optimistic news across several cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward trend, bolstered by pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals' investment. Ethereum is also on an upward trajectory, breaking the $3,000 mark with potential for further gains. Solana is gaining traction with the potential for a new ETF and bullish price predictions. Dogecoin has seen volatility due to political speculation, while Tether remains stable with significant minting activity indicating anticipated demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and bullish news, including institutional investments and political support, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and breaking key price levels, along with ETF-related news, support a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and ETF filing news provide a positive outlook, though technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political speculation-driven volatility, technical indicators do not support a strong directional move.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-11-20 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic indicators and significant developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest, as seen with Bitcoin nearing $95K and Ethereum breaking the $3K mark. Solana is also showing bullish patterns with potential for further gains, supported by ETF filings. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political hype, while Tether is maintaining stability with recent minting activities in anticipation of market demand. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable gold and oil prices, supports a risk-on environment, favoring allocations into cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news flow, including ETF optimism and institutional adoption, suggest further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking the $3K mark and potential for further gains make ETH attractive, supported by bullish technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF filings and bullish technical signals indicate potential for significant upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political hype, the lack of strong technical signals or sustained momentum suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish market environment, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns from other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-20 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news, such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism. Bitcoin's price surge is further supported by institutional interest, as evidenced by Acurx Pharmaceuticals' allocation to BTC. Ethereum's recent price increase past $3,000 is bolstered by analyst predictions of further gains. Solana is also experiencing bullish sentiment, with ETF filings and predictions of significant price increases. Dogecoin, however, is experiencing volatility with recent price swings influenced by political developments. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with recent minting suggesting anticipation of increased market demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news, including institutional interest and ETF optimism, support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Continued upward price movement and positive analyst predictions suggest further gains, despite recent volatility.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from ETF filings and potential price targets support a positive outlook, though recent price decreases warrant caution.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price volatility and lack of clear bullish signals suggest caution, despite political hype.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-11-20 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic backdrop remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant changes in traditional financial indicators, leading to a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's price is nearing all-time highs with strong buy signals and bullish momentum. Positive news regarding institutional interest and political support further strengthens its outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum has broken through key resistance levels, supported by ETF-related news and bullish technical indicators, suggesting potential for further upside.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana shows strong technical indicators and bullish sentiment, with ETF filings indicating increased institutional interest, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some political hype, DOGE lacks strong technical or momentum signals, and recent price volatility suggests caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in major cryptocurrencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-20 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent surge past $95K is fueled by pro-crypto political developments and institutional interest, while Ethereum's break above $3K is supported by ETF-related news. Solana is also experiencing bullish sentiment, with potential ETF filings and price predictions suggesting further gains. However, Dogecoin's recent price swings appear speculative, driven by political hype rather than fundamental strength. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven, but the broader market's bullish undertone suggests a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news from institutional adoption and political support suggest continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent technical setbacks, positive news and a potential move towards $3,800 provide a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment supported by ETF filing and technical patterns indicating potential for significant price increases.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative price movements driven by political news, but lacking strong technical or fundamental support.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment turns bullish, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on growth in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum driven by positive macroeconomic news, such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and ETF optimism, which has pushed its price near $95K. Ethereum has also broken past the $3K mark, with potential for further gains. Solana is showing potential for significant growth with ETF filings and bullish price predictions. However, Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with political news influencing its price swings, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market demand. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a slight shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. On-chain activity is robust, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technicals, breaking the $3K barrier and positive news about ETF developments provide a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive news about ETF filings and bullish price predictions, combined with a slight recovery in price, support a favorable outlook.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and lack of strong technical signals suggest caution. Political news-driven spikes are not sustainable for long-term growth.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans towards risk-taking, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-20 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments such as Trump's pro-crypto stance boosting Bitcoin and the anticipation of various ETFs for Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin is nearing $95K, supported by institutional interest and positive news. Ethereum has broken the $3K barrier, with potential for further growth. Solana is seeing bullish predictions and ETF interest, while Dogecoin experiences volatility due to political hype. Tether remains stable, with new minting suggesting anticipation of increased demand. The macroeconomic context shows relatively stable conditions with moderate volatility, which supports a balanced approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with positive news on institutional adoption and ETF optimism, suggesting continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum has broken a key price level, and while technicals are mixed, news of ETF developments supports a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bullish sentiment, driven by ETF interest and price predictions, indicates potential for upward movement, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price swings and political attention, the lack of strong technical signals or sustained momentum suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-20 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum has broken the $3K mark, with potential for further gains, although technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is gaining attention with ETF filings and bullish price predictions, though technical signals are not yet supportive. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility due to political news, but lacks strong technical backing. Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased demand, but the stablecoin remains a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and technical indicators. Institutional interest and ETF optimism further bolster confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Price has broken key levels with potential for further gains, but technical signals are mixed, warranting cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news about ETF filings and bullish price predictions, though technical indicators are not yet aligned, suggesting moderate confidence.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite political news-driven volatility, technical indicators do not support a strong directional move.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins in favor of more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-20 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $95K driven by pro-crypto political developments and ETF optimism. Ethereum has broken past $3K, with analysts predicting further upward movement. Solana is also experiencing bullish sentiment, with ETF filings and ambitious price targets. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to political news, while Tether's recent minting suggests anticipation of increased market activity. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, supports a moderate risk-on environment, encouraging a shift from stablecoins to more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF optimism and institutional interest. Positive news and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Breaking the $3K barrier with potential for further gains. However, technicals are not as strong as BTC, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment driven by ETF news and technical patterns. Despite no immediate buy signals, the overall outlook remains positive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest due to political news, but lacking strong technical support. A slight positive score reflects potential for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments such as Trump's pro-crypto stance and the anticipation of crypto ETFs. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, nearing $95K, supported by institutional interest and ETF optimism. Ethereum, while breaking the $3K mark, shows mixed technical signals but remains buoyed by positive news like the Grayscale ETF share split. Solana is gaining attention with ETF filings and bullish price predictions, although technical indicators are not yet aligned. Dogecoin is influenced by political news and speculative trading, showing volatility without clear directional momentum. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests preparation for increased market activity, though it remains a stable option amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news support a bullish stance. Institutional interest and ETF optimism further bolster confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, breaking the $3K barrier and positive news like the ETF share split provide a moderate bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news on potential ETF and bullish price predictions support an optimistic view, though technicals are not yet fully supportive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Volatility driven by speculative and political news, but lacking clear technical or fundamental signals to justify a directional move.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in the crypto market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by positive regulatory news and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened crypto demand. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and regaining dominance in USDT supply. Solana's recent price surge to record highs and the filing of a Solana ETF suggest growing institutional focus. Dogecoin has seen a boost in interest due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with developments in regulatory-compliant alternatives emerging in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum supported by positive regulatory news and increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest through ETF inflows and regaining USDT dominance provide a supportive backdrop, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and institutional interest, as indicated by the ETF filing, suggest a favorable outlook despite mixed technical signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — High-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation provide a positive sentiment boost, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, maintaining high exposure to USDT is less attractive in the current environment."
2024-11-21 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating a growing demand for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is seeing significant institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its reclaiming of the top spot for Tether issuance. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting record highs and attracting institutional focus with a new ETF filing. Dogecoin has seen a buzz from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, although its technical indicators remain mixed. In this environment, USDT serves as a stable reserve, but the market's risk appetite appears to be shifting towards more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news and increased on-chain activity. The potential regulatory reforms and stablecoin inflows further support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest and positive news about Tether issuance, although technical indicators are not yet fully supportive.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high and the upcoming ETF filing indicate strong market confidence and potential for further gains, supported by bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite mixed technicals, Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, suggesting potential for near-term appreciation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, the relative attractiveness of holding USDT decreases slightly."
2024-11-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-21 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by positive news about potential regulatory reforms and increasing stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows, although its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana is gaining traction with record highs and institutional interest through ETF filings, suggesting robust investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin is seeing attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though its technical indicators are not yet supportive. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with Ethereum regaining its dominance in USDT supply, but the emergence of new stablecoin alternatives could impact its market position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The potential regulatory reforms and stablecoin inflows further boost confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Institutional interest through ETF inflows is a positive sign, though technical indicators are currently neutral. The market's focus on Ethereum's USDT dominance adds a slight bullish tilt.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and institutional interest through ETF filings indicate strong investor enthusiasm, despite mixed technical signals. The asset is well-positioned for continued growth.

DOGE: +0.2 — High-profile endorsements and whale accumulation provide a positive sentiment boost, although technical indicators remain neutral. The asset's potential for speculative interest warrants a modest positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, USDT is less attractive in the current environment, despite its stability and dominance in the market."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly positive, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark, driven by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana is also experiencing heightened investor enthusiasm, reaching record highs and attracting institutional focus with ETF filings. Dogecoin is buoyed by high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation, although its technical indicators remain mixed. In contrast, USDT is experiencing a slight decline in technical signals, but remains a stable store of value amidst the broader market rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news catalysts and significant on-chain activity, suggesting continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite mixed technical signals, strong institutional interest and its regained USDT dominance provide a supportive backdrop for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record highs and institutional attention through ETF filings indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, significant whale accumulation and high-profile endorsements provide a positive sentiment boost.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT seems prudent."
2024-11-21 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is approaching the $100K mark, fueled by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating strong demand. Ethereum is seeing substantial institutional interest with significant ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana is experiencing record highs and growing institutional focus, evidenced by the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but is facing competition from new regulated stablecoins in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating continued demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding USDT supply dominance provide a supportive backdrop, although technical indicators are mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and institutional interest through ETF filings suggest strong momentum and potential for continued growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, but technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, USDT may see reduced demand in the short term."
2024-11-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating a strong demand for crypto assets. Ethereum is seeing robust institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana continues to attract attention with its record high prices and institutional focus, highlighted by the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is experiencing a buzz due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, while Tether remains stable but faces competition from new regulated alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with significant price increases and positive news regarding potential regulatory reforms. The bullish sentiment is further supported by record stablecoin inflows.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest and regained USDT supply dominance. The recent ETF inflows suggest a positive outlook despite mixed technical signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high prices and the filing for a Solana ETF indicate strong market interest and potential for further gains. Positive momentum and volume support a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, the appointment of Musk to a government taskforce and whale accumulation provide a positive sentiment boost, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a potential for capital rotation out of stablecoins as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-21 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows indicating increased demand for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and regaining its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana continues to attract attention with its record high prices and the filing of a Solana ETF, suggesting growing institutional focus. Dogecoin is benefiting from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, while USDT remains stable but faces competition from new regulated stablecoin alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with positive news on regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong institutional interest, as reflected in ETF inflows and its dominance in Tether issuance, supports a positive outlook despite mixed short-term technicals.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record high prices and the filing for a Solana ETF highlight strong investor enthusiasm and potential for continued growth, justifying a moderately positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, the lack of strong technical signals tempers the enthusiasm slightly.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-21 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating strong demand. Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance and is seeing substantial institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows. Solana has reached an all-time high, fueled by growing adoption and the potential for a Solana ETF, highlighting rising institutional focus. Dogecoin is experiencing increased attention due to high-profile endorsements and significant accumulation by large holders. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but there is a notable shift in dominance back to Ethereum for Tether supply.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by macroeconomic optimism and record stablecoin inflows. The potential for regulatory reforms adds to the positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and strong institutional interest via ETF inflows. The reclaiming of USDT dominance further boosts Ethereum's attractiveness.

SOL: +0.5 — Record high prices and the prospect of a Solana ETF highlight increasing institutional interest and adoption, supporting a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation suggest potential for upward movement.

USDT: -0.4 — With rising risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, USDT demand may decrease as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic indicators and significant developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand. Ethereum has seen substantial institutional interest, with significant ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana is experiencing strong momentum, having reached an all-time high, and is attracting institutional attention with the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin has gained attention due to high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is seeing some competition from new stablecoin alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued demand and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's strong institutional interest and recent price breakout above the upper Bollinger Band indicate a bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high and institutional focus, along with positive technical indicators, suggest continued strength and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen some positive sentiment and whale accumulation, its price movements are less pronounced, leading to a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing a bullish trend, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-21 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand. Ethereum is experiencing significant institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana has hit a record high, supported by growing adoption and the potential for an ETF, while Dogecoin is benefiting from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. In contrast, USDT remains stable but lacks bullish signals, suggesting a shift towards riskier assets as market confidence grows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, including pro-crypto regulatory optimism and record stablecoin inflows, support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional interest and technical breakouts indicate strong market confidence, warranting a higher allocation despite recent price surges.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and potential ETF developments signal strong investor enthusiasm, justifying increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — High-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation create a positive outlook, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite grows, capital is rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, suggesting a reduced allocation to USDT."
2024-11-21 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the psychological $100K mark, buoyed by positive regulatory news and record stablecoin inflows, indicating strong demand. Ethereum is experiencing robust institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana is attracting attention with its record high prices and potential ETF launch, reflecting growing adoption and investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but less attractive as investors rotate capital into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive regulatory news and stablecoin inflows, suggests continued price appreciation. The pro-crypto sentiment from political developments further enhances its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's regained USDT dominance and significant ETF inflows indicate strong institutional interest, supporting a bullish outlook. The recent price breakout above the upper Bollinger Band reinforces this positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high prices and potential ETF launch signal increasing institutional focus and adoption. The bullish momentum and significant price increase further support a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, suggesting potential upside. However, its meme coin status warrants a more cautious approach compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With rising risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, USDT's appeal diminishes. The stablecoin's lack of bullish signals and the broader market's bullish sentiment justify reducing exposure."
2024-11-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, with notable upward momentum in several major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting a growing demand for crypto assets. Ethereum is also experiencing strong institutional interest, reflected in significant ETF inflows and its reclaiming of the top spot for USDT supply. Solana is gaining attention due to its record high prices and potential ETF developments, indicating rising institutional focus. Dogecoin is seeing a buzz from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, although its price has recently dipped. USDT remains stable but is seeing competition from new regulated alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum supported by positive news on regulatory optimism and increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from significant ETF inflows and its dominance in USDT supply, indicating strong institutional interest and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record high and potential ETF developments highlight strong investor enthusiasm, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price dips, Dogecoin is supported by high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, suggesting potential for recovery and moderate gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, USDT may see reduced demand as investors seek higher returns elsewhere."
2024-11-21 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional interest and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and record stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum is seeing significant institutional inflows into ETFs and has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance, further boosting its appeal. Solana continues to attract attention with its all-time high prices and potential ETF developments, while Dogecoin benefits from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with positive news on regulatory reforms and record stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued demand and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional interest is high with substantial ETF inflows, and its dominance in USDT supply enhances its attractiveness, supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Record high prices and potential ETF developments indicate strong investor enthusiasm and adoption, justifying increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation, though it remains a more speculative play.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into higher-risk assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-21 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by optimism surrounding potential regulatory reforms and strong stablecoin inflows, indicating increased demand. Ethereum is experiencing a resurgence in interest, with institutional investments pouring into ETFs and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana has reached record highs, buoyed by growing adoption and potential ETF filings. Dogecoin is seeing increased attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with some shifts in blockchain dominance but no major disruptions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and significant stablecoin inflows, suggesting continued demand and potential price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from strong institutional interest and positive news regarding USDT supply dominance, indicating a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record high and potential ETF filing highlight its growing institutional interest, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen some positive news and whale accumulation, its speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, a reduced allocation to USDT is appropriate to capitalize on bullish market conditions."
2024-11-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, fueled by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and strong stablecoin inflows indicating increased demand. Ethereum is seeing significant institutional interest with large ETF inflows and reclaiming the top spot for USDT supply. Solana has reached an all-time high, supported by growing adoption and institutional focus, as evidenced by the filing of a Solana ETF. Dogecoin is experiencing increased attention due to high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with Ethereum regaining dominance in Tether issuance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum from both macroeconomic optimism and increased stablecoin inflows. Positive news sentiment supports further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and reclaiming USDT supply dominance are bullish indicators. Strong ETF inflows suggest continued upward potential.

SOL: +0.7 — Record high prices and institutional focus, including ETF filings, indicate strong market confidence and potential for further growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from high-profile endorsements and whale accumulation, though the meme nature of the asset warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-21 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly positive, with notable bullish developments across several cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around potential regulatory reforms and increased stablecoin inflows, which indicate rising demand for crypto assets. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and its regained position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Solana has reached a record high, driven by growing adoption and the prospect of a Solana ETF, highlighting increasing institutional focus. Dogecoin is seeing renewed attention due to high-profile endorsements and significant accumulation by large holders. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, but the launch of MiCA-compliant alternatives in Europe suggests a competitive landscape for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong market optimism and increased demand, as indicated by stablecoin inflows and positive news around regulatory reforms. The technical indicators suggest a buy signal, supporting a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's regained dominance in USDT supply and substantial ETF inflows reflect strong institutional interest, providing a bullish backdrop. Technical indicators also support continued upward momentum.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record high and the potential for an ETF highlight strong investor enthusiasm. The technical indicators remain positive, suggesting further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin is gaining traction from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation. The positive sentiment and technical indicators support a moderately bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — While USDT remains stable, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation of capital into riskier assets. The launch of new stablecoin alternatives may also impact its dominance."
2024-11-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic developments and strong institutional interest. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by optimism around regulatory reforms and significant stablecoin inflows, indicating heightened demand for crypto assets. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows and its regained dominance in USDT supply. Solana is also benefiting from increased adoption and investor enthusiasm, reaching record highs and attracting institutional focus with a potential ETF. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to high-profile endorsements and significant accumulation by large holders. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but sees competition from new regulated alternatives in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding regulatory reforms and stablecoin inflows support a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic environment is conducive to risk-on assets, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional interest is high, with significant ETF inflows and regained USDT dominance. The technical indicators also support a bullish stance, making ETH a strong candidate for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and growing institutional focus, along with a potential ETF, indicate strong market sentiment. The technicals are supportive, suggesting continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive news from high-profile endorsements and significant whale accumulation provide a bullish sentiment, though the overall impact is less pronounced compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other crypto assets, USDT's relative attractiveness decreases. However, it remains a stable option for hedging against volatility."
2024-11-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana has reached a new all-time high and is gaining traction in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative news regarding potential integration into Elon Musk's payment system, while Tether continues to see significant minting activity, aligning with the broader market rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are driving it towards a new all-time high, indicating a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive momentum support a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DeFi activity position it as a strong contender for capital allocation, reflecting growing investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative news regarding potential integration into a major payment system provides a positive sentiment boost, though the overall impact remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing a bullish trend, there is a shift away from stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark driven by strong institutional inflows and significant ETF investments. Ethereum is also experiencing positive momentum, breaking out of a long-term downtrend, although recent whale sell-offs have introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a significant price jump due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, further supported by strategic acquisitions aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Meanwhile, Tether's increased minting activity aligns with the broader crypto market rally, suggesting a demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news, coupled with its approach to a new all-time high, indicate robust upward momentum, making it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive momentum suggest potential for further gains, though with slightly less confidence than BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence in the DeFi space, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — The potential integration into X's payment system and strategic acquisitions are boosting Dogecoin's appeal, though the speculative nature warrants a moderate score.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across other assets, there's a strategic shift away from stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on the upward trends in the market."
2024-11-22 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high near $100K, driven by strong institutional inflows and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is also experiencing positive momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend and showing significant daily gains, although recent whale activity introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong investor confidence and growing DeFi prominence. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether continues to mint significant amounts of USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are highly supportive, with the asset nearing a significant psychological milestone of $100K, indicating strong upward momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains suggest a positive outlook, though slightly tempered by recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence and investor confidence, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around potential integration into X's payment system and strategic acquisitions are boosting sentiment, though the asset remains more volatile compared to others.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on the current market rally."
2024-11-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-22 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF investments. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a significant whale sell-off, but it has shown a strong breakout from a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around Elon Musk's potential integration of DOGE into X's payment system. Tether's recent minting activities align with the broader market rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum, supported by institutional inflows and ETF news, suggests a continued upward trajectory. The macroeconomic environment remains favorable for BTC as a hedge.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from whale activity, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news indicate potential for further gains, though with some caution due to recent sell-offs.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing prominence and investor confidence, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from Elon Musk's speculation and Spirit Blockchain's acquisition provides some upward momentum, though the overall impact remains moderate.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish trends, there's a reduced need for stablecoin holdings as capital rotates into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100,000, supported by ETF inflows and optimism post-U.S. elections. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a whale sell-off but shows signs of breaking out of a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume and hitting a new all-time high. Dogecoin's price is influenced by speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity aligns with Bitcoin's rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong institutional inflows indicate robust upward momentum. The ETF news further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive momentum suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around potential integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a modestly positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation away from stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and significant institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a whale sell-off, but its recent breakout from a downtrend suggests potential for further gains. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation about its integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether's increased minting activity aligns with the broader market rally, providing liquidity for trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and new all-time high signal robust upward momentum, making it a priority for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high support a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around Elon Musk's potential integration of Dogecoin into X's payment system provides a short-term boost, justifying a slight positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100K, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating robust institutional interest. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to large whale activity but has shown strong momentum with a recent breakout. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, highlighting its growing role in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong ETF inflows suggest continued upward momentum. Institutional interest remains a key driver.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high support a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DeFi activity make it an attractive asset, with strong investor confidence and growing prominence.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a slightly positive stance, though volatility remains.

2024-11-22 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, nearing the $100,000 mark, supported by strong ETF inflows and optimism post-U.S. elections. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off, yet it shows strong momentum with recent gains. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether's increased minting aligns with Bitcoin's rally, suggesting a robust demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and substantial ETF inflows indicate strong upward momentum and institutional interest, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high suggest a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing prominence and investor confidence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions support a moderate positive outlook, though it remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum has shown significant price movements, though recent whale sell-offs have introduced volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin has experienced a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's payment system, while Tether's increased minting activity aligns with Bitcoin's rally, suggesting a preparation for heightened trading activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and nearing a psychological price milestone, makes it attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from whale activity, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high warrant a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence in the DeFi space, justifying a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into Elon Musk's payment system and strategic acquisitions in the DOGE ecosystem provide a modest positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-11-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100K, supported by ETF inflows, while Ethereum is experiencing a strong upward momentum despite some volatility from whale activity. Solana continues to gain prominence, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume and hitting a new all-time high. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity aligns with the broader crypto rally, indicating increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional support and ETF inflows, combined with its new all-time high, suggest continued upward momentum. The macroeconomic environment remains supportive, with low volatility and a stable S&P 500.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains indicate positive momentum. The potential for a new all-time high adds to its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing importance in the DeFi space, making it a strong candidate for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and recent acquisitions in the DOGE ecosystem provide a positive sentiment boost, though the technicals are less compelling.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing strong bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need to hold stablecoins, prompting a rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-22 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows into Bitcoin and the recent surge in Bitcoin's price to near $100,000. This optimism is further supported by the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted substantial capital. Ethereum has also experienced a notable price increase, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend, although recent whale sell-offs have introduced some volatility. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activities suggest a strategic response to the increased demand for liquidity amid the Bitcoin rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news have driven Bitcoin to new highs, indicating continued bullish momentum. The recent surge in transaction activity further supports this positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant daily gains suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, though volatility remains a concern.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and its growing prominence in the DeFi space, as evidenced by surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume, highlight its increasing attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.5 — Speculation around integration into Elon Musk's X payment system and strategic acquisitions by Spirit Blockchain Capital provide a positive sentiment boost.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing strong bullish signals, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a shift towards more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching new highs and significant institutional inflows, particularly into Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark is supported by strong institutional interest and favorable macroeconomic conditions, such as stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to whale activity but shows strong momentum, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating its growing influence in the DeFi space. Dogecoin benefits from speculative interest and potential integration into new payment systems, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests a readiness to support increased trading volumes amid the Bitcoin rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with institutional support and ETF inflows, making it an attractive asset in the current bullish environment.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some volatility from whale sell-offs, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high support a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and potential integration into new payment systems provide a positive, albeit cautious, outlook for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining high exposure to stablecoins is less attractive."
2024-11-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, driven by strong institutional inflows and ETF-related optimism. Ethereum has shown significant price movement, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend despite some volatility from large sell-offs. Solana is gaining traction, reaching new all-time highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating growing confidence in its ecosystem. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional support and ETF inflows, coupled with its approach to a new all-time high, indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from whale activity, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high suggest a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and ecosystem expansion provide a mild positive sentiment, though with some caution due to volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall bullish market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, USDT is less attractive, prompting a reduction in stablecoin exposure."
2024-11-22 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news developments. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100,000, supported by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest. Ethereum, despite some volatility due to a large whale sell-off, has shown signs of breaking out of a prolonged downtrend with a notable daily gain. Solana continues to gain traction, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume and reaching a new all-time high, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin has experienced a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's payment system, while Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with Bitcoin's rally. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant changes in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and reaching an all-time high, makes it a highly attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell pressure from a whale, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high suggest moderate upside potential.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and its surpassing of Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing prominence, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into a major payment system and recent news developments support a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-11-22 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and optimism in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, nearing $100,000, supported by strong ETF inflows. Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking out of a prolonged downtrend despite recent whale sell-offs. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether's increased minting activity aligns with the broader market rally, suggesting heightened demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional support and ETF inflows, along with its new all-time high, signal robust upward momentum. The asset remains attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from whale activity, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for new highs make it moderately attractive, though less so than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing DeFi prominence, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and ecosystem expansion supports a slight increase in allocation, though with caution due to its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less desirable at this time."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high near $100,000, supported by ETF inflows and post-election optimism. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off but shows strong momentum with a recent breakout from a downtrend. Solana continues to gain prominence, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX trading volume. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system. Meanwhile, Tether is actively minting USDT to meet increased demand amid the Bitcoin rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, institutional inflows, and ETF-related news suggest continued bullishness. The asset remains highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and potential for a new all-time high make it moderately attractive.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and increased DEX trading volume highlight its growing strength in the DeFi space, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from potential integration into X's payment system and ecosystem expansion news provide a slight bullish tilt, but caution is advised due to recent volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-11-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs near $100,000 and significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This optimism is further supported by Ethereum's breakout from a prolonged downtrend, although some volatility is present due to large whale sell-offs. Solana continues to gain traction, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating strong growth in the DeFi space. Dogecoin's price is buoyed by speculation of integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, while Tether's recent minting activity aligns with the broader crypto rally, suggesting increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are highly supportive, with technical indicators showing a buy signal despite some recent price fluctuations.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and positive news signal potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing prominence, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around Elon Musk's potential integration of DOGE into X's payment system provides a slight bullish sentiment, though the technicals are already strong.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets to capture potential gains."
2024-11-22 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the anticipation of Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 milestone. Ethereum is experiencing volatility due to a large whale sell-off, but it has shown strong momentum with a recent breakout from a long downtrend. Solana continues to gain traction, achieving a new all-time high and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange trading volume, indicating growing investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a price spike due to speculation around potential integration into Elon Musk's X payment system, further supported by strategic acquisitions aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting USDT, aligning with the broader market rally, but its role remains primarily as a stable asset amid the bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news are driving Bitcoin towards a new all-time high, indicating robust upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility from a whale sell-off, Ethereum's breakout from a downtrend and significant price gains suggest a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new all-time high and dominance in DEX trading volume highlight its growing importance in the DeFi space, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation around integration into X's payment system and strategic acquisitions support a modest positive sentiment, although the price has already reacted to the news.

USDT: 0.0 — As the market remains bullish, there is no immediate need to hold USDT, but maintaining a neutral stance allows for flexibility in reallocating to more volatile assets if needed."
2024-11-23 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, however, faces resistance at $3.4K, with declining open interest suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana continues to show strong bullish momentum, having recently hit an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets due to rising adoption. Dogecoin is experiencing a surge in interest, with technicals suggesting a potential rally if momentum persists. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its supply to meet rising demand, indicating increased liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF inflows and positive sentiment about surpassing $100K. The technicals and news support a bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Facing resistance and declining open interest suggest a cautious approach. No clear bullish signals in the short term despite slight price increases.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and raised price targets indicate strong bullish momentum and adoption, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and potential for further rally based on technicals and renewed interest in memecoins.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more capital into higher-performing assets."
2024-11-23 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum faces resistance at $3,400, with declining futures open interest indicating reduced trading activity. Solana continues its upward trajectory, reaching an all-time high and receiving optimistic price targets from analysts. Dogecoin has seen a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting potential for further gains. Tether has increased its supply significantly to meet market demand, reflecting a robust liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive sentiment about reaching $100K. The market is optimistic, and BTC's position as a leading asset makes it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite facing resistance at $3,400, the lack of bullish technical signals and reduced trading activity suggest a neutral stance. No strong catalysts for immediate upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and positive analyst projections make SOL attractive. Continued adoption and bullish momentum support further gains, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price surge and potential for further breakout to $0.82 suggest a favorable outlook. High volume and memecoin interest provide additional support for a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent. The increased USDT supply indicates ample liquidity, allowing for reallocation into other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, with declining open interest suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains due to rising adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge, driven by renewed interest and high volume, with technicals suggesting potential for further upward movement. Tether has increased its supply to meet rising demand, indicating a healthy liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with ETF inflows and positive sentiment suggesting potential for surpassing $100K. Current holdings should benefit from further upside.

ETH: 0.0 — Facing resistance and declining open interest suggest a potential pullback; maintain current exposure without increasing allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Reaching an all-time high with bullish momentum and positive analyst projections. Increasing allocation to capitalize on potential further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant recent surge and potential for further rally, but already substantial holdings warrant a cautious increase.

USDT: -0.4 — With rising risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, reduce exposure to stablecoins to allocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2024-11-23 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K milestone driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows mixed signals with reduced trading activity. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains due to rising adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, with predictions of further rallies. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet market demand, indicating a robust appetite for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K make BTC highly attractive. Despite some technical indicators not fully aligning, the macro news is overwhelmingly positive.

ETH: 0.0 — While ETH faces resistance and reduced open interest, its recent price increase suggests holding the current position without further allocation until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — With SOL hitting an all-time high and analysts raising price targets, the asset shows strong bullish momentum and adoption, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — DOGE's significant price jump and potential for further rallies due to technical momentum suggest a moderate increase in allocation, balancing risk and opportunity.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on bullish market conditions."
2024-11-23 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF demand and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of reduced trading activity, which could indicate a short-term pullback. Solana has reached an all-time high, bolstered by strong demand and bullish momentum, with analysts raising price targets further. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technical indicators suggesting potential further gains. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting new USDT to meet rising demand, reflecting a robust liquidity position in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF-related inflows and positive sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making BTC a preferred allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish sentiment in the broader market, ETH faces resistance and reduced open interest, indicating potential short-term stagnation.

SOL: +0.6 — Reaching an all-time high with strong demand and bullish projections supports a positive allocation, though slightly cautious due to recent rapid gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge and technical indicators pointing to further gains justify a positive allocation, although mindful of its volatile nature.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-11-23 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-23 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum in several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, suggesting a high likelihood of surpassing this milestone by year-end. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows reduced trading activity, indicating potential short-term consolidation. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains due to rising adoption. Dogecoin has experienced a substantial surge, fueled by renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals pointing to the possibility of further rallies. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet market demand, reflecting increased liquidity needs.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding ETF inflows suggest further price appreciation. The likelihood of surpassing $100K supports a bullish allocation.

ETH: +0.1 — While facing resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and market cap stability warrant a slight positive allocation, anticipating potential recovery.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and bullish projections for further gains make Solana an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase and potential for further rallies due to technical indicators justify a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is expected, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-23 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by significant ETF inflows and strong market sentiment predicting further gains. Solana has hit an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets due to increased adoption and demand. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows signs of a potential pullback, as indicated by a drop in futures open interest. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting further upside potential. Tether has increased its supply to meet rising market demand, indicating a need for liquidity in the crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment suggest further upside potential, making BTC a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, the overall bullish market environment and recent price increase warrant a slight positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and raised price targets indicate strong momentum and adoption, making SOL attractive for increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further gains justify a moderate positive allocation, though volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-11-23 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF inflows, suggesting a potential breakout if momentum continues. Ethereum faces resistance at $3.4K, with a decline in futures open interest indicating reduced trading activity. Solana has reached an all-time high, with bullish projections suggesting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, with technical indicators pointing to a potential rally. Meanwhile, Tether has increased its supply to meet rising demand, reflecting a stable market environment for USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment suggest a high probability of BTC surpassing $100K, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $3.4K, the overall bullish market environment supports a modest positive outlook, though caution is advised due to reduced open interest.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and bullish momentum, along with a raised price target, indicate strong potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price surge and technical indicators suggest potential for continued upward movement, though volatility remains a consideration.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on bullish trends in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-23 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with ETF inflows and positive sentiment suggesting a potential breakthrough above $100K. The macroeconomic environment supports risk-on assets.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, ETH maintains bullish momentum. However, reduced open interest suggests caution, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and bullish projections support a strong buy signal, with the potential for further gains amid rising adoption.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge and technical indicators suggest further upside potential, though the speculative nature warrants a balanced approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, holding USDT is less attractive in the current bullish environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to significant ETF inflows and strong market confidence in reaching even higher levels by year-end. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows mixed signals with reduced futures activity. Solana continues its strong performance, hitting an all-time high with expectations for further gains. Dogecoin has seen a significant surge driven by memecoin interest, with technicals suggesting potential for further rally. Tether has increased its supply significantly, indicating strong demand for liquidity, although this is typical for a stablecoin in volatile markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and bullish sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, ETH faces resistance and reduced futures activity, suggesting a cautious approach until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — With an all-time high and bullish projections, SOL remains a strong candidate for further investment, supported by rising adoption.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price surge and potential for further rally make DOGE appealing, although volatility should be monitored closely.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish market conditions, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-23 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a strong bullish sentiment, particularly for Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows mixed signals with reduced open interest but remains in a bullish technical setup. Solana continues its upward trajectory, hitting an all-time high with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price jump driven by renewed interest, with potential for further upside. Tether's recent minting activity indicates increased demand for liquidity, but in a bullish crypto market, the preference may lean towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $3.4K, ETH maintains a bullish technical setup, but reduced open interest warrants a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Record highs and bullish projections support a positive outlook, with strong demand driving further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent surge and potential for further rally make DOGE an appealing choice, though it's important to remain cautious given its volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT in favor of higher-risk assets with growth potential."
2024-11-23 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments in Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K milestone, fueled by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, with analysts predicting a high likelihood of surpassing this level by year-end. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts raising price targets further, indicating strong demand and adoption. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows bullish momentum, though reduced open interest suggests caution. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, with potential for further gains if momentum continues. Tether's recent minting of USDT suggests increased liquidity demand, but with a bullish market, capital may rotate out of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and bullish sentiment suggest further upside potential. Analysts' predictions of surpassing $100K add confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $3.4K, bullish momentum and recent price increases support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Record high prices and raised price targets indicate strong bullish momentum and adoption, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price surge and potential for further gains due to technical indicators and renewed interest in memecoins.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish market sentiment across other assets, a rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-11-23 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-23 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100K milestone driven by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, indicating potential short-term consolidation, while Solana continues its bullish trajectory, hitting an all-time high and receiving upward price targets from analysts. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, although recent price volatility suggests caution. Tether's issuance of new USDT indicates strong demand for liquidity, reflecting a balanced risk appetite in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF-driven momentum and positive sentiment suggest further upside potential, despite the lack of short-term technical buy signals.

ETH: +0.3 — While facing resistance and reduced futures activity, the overall bullish market environment and recent price increases justify a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued bullish momentum and recent all-time highs, along with positive analyst projections, support an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, strong technical indicators and potential for further gains warrant a cautious positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital moving towards growth assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is appropriate."
2024-11-23 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment suggesting a strong likelihood of surpassing this milestone by year-end. Ethereum is facing resistance at $3.4K, with reduced futures open interest indicating a potential short-term pullback. Solana has reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains due to rising adoption. Dogecoin has seen a notable surge due to renewed interest in memecoins, with technicals suggesting a potential rally. Tether has increased its supply significantly to meet rising demand, indicating a healthy liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with ETF-related inflows and positive sentiment suggesting a potential breakthrough of the $100K mark. Maintain a high allocation to capitalize on this momentum.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, the overall bullish market sentiment and support from other assets warrant a slight positive allocation, but caution is advised due to potential short-term pullbacks.

SOL: +0.5 — Reaching all-time highs with bullish momentum and a raised price target. Positive sentiment and strong demand support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent surge and potential for further rally based on technicals. Moderate allocation increase to capture potential upside while remaining cautious of volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to reallocate capital towards more promising assets."
2024-11-23 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin nearing a significant milestone of $100K driven by ETF inflows, suggesting strong bullish sentiment. Ethereum, while facing resistance, maintains bullish momentum despite a drop in futures open interest. Solana continues its bullish trajectory, reaching all-time highs with optimistic price targets. Dogecoin has seen a significant price surge due to renewed interest, though technical indicators suggest potential for further gains. Tether's recent minting activity indicates high demand for liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Strong upward momentum driven by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment with a high likelihood of surpassing $100K. Despite short-term technical resistance, the long-term outlook remains bullish.

**ETH: +0.3** — While facing resistance at $3.4K, ETH maintains bullish momentum. The drop in futures open interest suggests caution, but overall sentiment remains positive due to macroeconomic stability.

**SOL: +0.6** — Recent all-time highs and bullish sentiment with a raised price target indicate strong demand and potential for further gains. The technical indicators support continued investment.

**DOGE: +0.2** — Recent price surge and potential for further gains suggest moderate bullish sentiment. However, the lack of strong technical confirmation warrants a cautious approach.

**USDT: -0.5** — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-11-23 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a strong focus on Bitcoin, which is nearing the $100K mark due to significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3,400, shows signs of reduced trading activity, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Solana continues to exhibit bullish momentum, having recently hit an all-time high with projections for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a recent surge driven by memecoin interest, but technical indicators suggest potential for further gains. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for liquidity, reflecting a stable environment for USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strong bullish sentiment driven by ETF inflows and the potential for BTC to surpass $100K by year-end makes it an attractive asset to increase exposure to, despite recent price fluctuations.

ETH: 0.0 — While Ethereum faces resistance and reduced trading activity, it maintains a buy signal on technical indicators. However, the lack of strong momentum and potential pullback suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent all-time high and positive analyst projections support a moderately bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation as it continues to show strong demand and adoption.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, the potential for a breakout to $0.82 and renewed interest in memecoins provide a moderate buy signal, though caution is advised given its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by significant ETF inflows and positive market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum faces resistance at $3,400, with declining open interest suggesting reduced trading activity. Solana continues its bullish trend, hitting an all-time high and receiving upward price target revisions. Dogecoin has seen a substantial price increase due to renewed interest, with technicals indicating potential for further gains. Tether's recent minting activity highlights increased demand for liquidity, although its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive positioning in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K by year-end support a bullish outlook, despite short-term technical weakness.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance at $3,400, Ethereum's overall bullish momentum remains intact, though reduced open interest suggests caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued bullish momentum and recent all-time highs, along with positive analyst projections, support further capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and potential for further gains suggest moderate bullishness, though volatility remains high.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains a neutral hold in the current market environment, with no immediate need for increased exposure given the bullish sentiment in other assets."
2024-11-23 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by strong ETF inflows and positive market sentiment, suggesting a high probability of surpassing this psychological level by year-end. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3,400, shows mixed signals with reduced futures open interest, indicating a potential short-term pullback. Solana continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, having reached an all-time high, with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed memecoin interest, with technicals suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether has increased its supply significantly to meet rising demand, reflecting a stable liquidity environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF-related news and market sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, with a high likelihood of surpassing $100K.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite facing resistance and reduced open interest, the overall market environment remains stable, warranting a hold position.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent all-time high and positive analyst projections indicate strong bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price surge and potential for further gains due to technical indicators, though risk remains due to its volatile nature.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and strong bullish signals in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-23 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark driven by ETF demand and strong market sentiment predicting further gains. Ethereum, while facing resistance at $3.4K, shows mixed signals with reduced futures activity. Solana continues its bullish trend, having hit an all-time high and with analysts projecting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to renewed interest, with technicals suggesting potential for further upside. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting new USDT to meet rising demand, indicating strong liquidity in the stablecoin market. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and strong equity markets, which could support continued risk-on sentiment in cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment with a high probability of surpassing $100K, making it attractive for further capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's overall market position remains strong, and the potential for a pullback is balanced by its long-term prospects.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued bullish momentum and recent all-time highs suggest further gains, supported by strong demand and positive analyst projections.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent surge and potential for further breakout make Dogecoin attractive, though its volatility warrants a more cautious approach compared to BTC and SOL.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT remains a safe haven, the current risk-on environment and capital rotation into other assets suggest maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-23 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a significant increase in value and positive staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining key support levels with a potential for further upward movement, while Dogecoin has experienced high volatility, with recent gains reversing and speculative interest remaining high. Tether continues to support market liquidity with significant new issuance, reflecting its role as a stabilizing force in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark indicates underlying strength. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong performance in November and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and reduced supply, warranting a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's defense of key support levels and potential for upward momentum support a positive allocation, though technical signals are not yet bullish.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and mixed signals from recent price movements and speculative interest suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing signs of cautious optimism, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to allow for increased exposure to other assets."
2024-11-24 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark but experiencing a pullback as traders take profits. Ethereum shows strong performance with significant staking inflows and a notable price increase in November, indicating investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced volatility, with a recent drop in price but high speculative interest as indicated by record open interest in derivatives. Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuance, although its role as a safe haven may diminish if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and high on-chain activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, supporting further upside potential.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment and support at key levels, coupled with positive market forecasts, suggest potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent price volatility and high speculative interest create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins is prudent."
2024-11-24 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating profit-taking and reassessment by traders. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, defending key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin experiences high volatility, with recent price drops but strong speculative interest as indicated by record open interest. Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, with potential large-scale Bitcoin-backed loan ventures in the pipeline. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a measured approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and bullish momentum signal suggests potential for further gains. However, caution is warranted due to profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, making it an attractive asset.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels, coupled with positive market forecasts, suggest potential for further upward movement.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and price drop, despite high speculative interest, warrant caution. Current holdings justify a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Neutral stance as Tether's increased issuance supports liquidity, but no immediate need to hold stablecoins given the current market conditions and risk appetite."
2024-11-24 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark, although it has pulled back slightly as traders take profits. Ethereum has shown strong performance with significant staking inflows and a notable price increase in November, indicating investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced volatility with a recent price drop, despite high speculative interest. Tether continues to provide market liquidity with substantial new issuances, supporting the broader crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and increased on-chain activity suggest a cautiously positive outlook. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong staking inflows and significant price increase in November reflect robust investor confidence. The consistent buy signal from trend indicators further supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and the persistence of bullish sentiment, along with bullish momentum signals, suggest potential for further gains, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price volatility and a significant drop, despite high speculative interest, suggest caution. Given current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: 0.0 — With the market showing mixed signals and USDT providing liquidity, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate to balance risk and opportunity."
2024-11-24 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced a notable drop, reflecting heightened volatility and speculative interest. Tether's substantial issuance supports market liquidity, indicating a stable demand for the stablecoin amidst these movements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent profit-taking, Bitcoin's approach to $100,000 and bullish on-chain activity suggest continued potential for gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong monthly performance and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and reduced supply, supporting further upside.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and technical support at key levels suggest potential for continued upward movement.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price drop and high volatility warrant caution, but strong speculative interest could lead to a rebound.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of risk appetite, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100K milestone before experiencing a pullback, indicating profit-taking and market reassessment. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with significant staking inflows and a notable 40% increase in November, suggesting a bullish outlook. Solana maintains bullish sentiment with key support levels defended and potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, faces volatility with a recent price drop, although speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuance, reflecting its role as a stable asset amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and bullish momentum signals suggest potential for further gains, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.7 — Strong staking activity and significant price increase in November highlight investor confidence and reduced supply, supporting a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and the defense of key support levels indicate potential for upward movement, making Solana an attractive asset.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price drop and high volatility suggest caution, recommending a slight reduction in exposure while monitoring speculative interest.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin issuance supports liquidity, but with no strong directional market signals, maintaining a neutral position is prudent."
2024-11-24 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a significant surge in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin, however, has experienced a notable drop, reflecting increased volatility and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with significant new issuance and potential strategic partnerships.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains. The market's overall positive sentiment supports maintaining a moderate allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong November performance and increased staking activity point to continued investor confidence. The buy signal from the trend indicators further supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and the persistent bullish sentiment indicate potential for upward movement, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent volatility and price drop suggest caution. While speculative interest remains high, the lack of bullish technical signals justifies a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing signs of cautious optimism, there is a slight preference to rotate capital into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly."
2024-11-24 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and market reassessment. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining a bullish sentiment, defending key support levels and showing potential for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a notable drop in price despite high speculative interest, as evidenced by record open interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance and potential strategic partnerships in the pipeline.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100K mark and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains. However, caution is warranted due to profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong performance in November and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment and reduced supply, supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for upward movement, though the recent price increase warrants a moderate allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and speculative interest create uncertainty, balancing potential upside with risk, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-24 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100,000 mark before experiencing a pullback, indicating profit-taking and market reassessment.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and proximity to the $100,000 mark suggest continued potential for gains. The bullish technical indicators support maintaining a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's increased staking activity and significant price appreciation in November indicate strong investor confidence and reduced supply, warranting a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's ability to hold key support levels and the persistence of bullish sentiment suggest potential for further price increases, though with slightly less conviction than Ethereum.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop create uncertainty, although speculative interest remains high. Given current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: 0.0 — With the market showing mixed signals, maintaining current USDT holdings provides a hedge against volatility while allowing flexibility for future capital allocation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly, indicating some profit-taking and market reassessment. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, holding key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a recent 12% drop, but high open interest suggests ongoing speculative interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with significant new issuance, while also exploring new ventures such as Bitcoin-backed loans.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's overall momentum remains positive with strong on-chain activity and a bullish trend signal. The market reassessment may provide a buying opportunity.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment, although technical signals are mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further gains, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent volatility and a significant price drop warrant caution, although speculative interest remains high. Reducing exposure might be prudent.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stable market conditions, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is appropriate as it provides liquidity without immediate allocation needs."
2024-11-24 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the psychological $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish sentiment with key support levels holding, while Dogecoin experiences high volatility and a notable price drop despite increased speculative interest. Tether's issuance continues to support market liquidity, with significant new minting in November.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's long-term bullish momentum remains intact, supported by strong on-chain activity and a buy signal from moving averages.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's increased staking and recent price surge suggest investor confidence, although technical indicators are mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels indicate potential for upward movement, though technical signals are currently neutral.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant recent price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, despite high speculative interest.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintaining a neutral position in USDT as market conditions are mixed, with no clear signal to increase or decrease stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-24 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark but pulling back as traders take profits, indicating a potential pause in its rally. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana is maintaining key support levels, with bullish sentiment persisting despite recent price fluctuations. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a notable drop in price, although speculative interest remains high. Tether continues to support market liquidity with substantial new issuances, indicating a stable demand for the stablecoin amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100,000 mark and prior bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains. However, caution is warranted given the profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong performance in November and increased staking inflows indicate positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, supporting a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's defense of key support levels and ongoing bullish sentiment suggest potential for upward movement, though recent price decreases warrant a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant price drop and high volatility signal caution, despite strong speculative interest. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

USDT: -0.2 — With no current holdings, a slight reduction in preference for USDT is suggested as the market shows mixed risk appetite, though liquidity support remains strong."
2024-11-24 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark but experiencing a pullback as traders take profits. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, defending key support levels and targeting higher resistance. Dogecoin has faced significant volatility, with a notable drop in price despite strong speculative interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance and potential involvement in Bitcoin-backed loans. Given the current macroeconomic context, with relatively stable indicators and low volatility, the market seems to be in a consolidation phase with cautious optimism.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100,000 mark and overall market cap strength suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is advised due to profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's defense of key support levels and bullish sentiment suggest potential for upward movement, although recent price increases warrant a moderate approach.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price volatility and a significant drop suggest caution, but strong speculative interest could provide support. Current holdings justify a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and its role in maintaining liquidity, USDT remains neutral. The potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggests maintaining flexibility in stablecoin allocation."
2024-11-24 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin's recent approach towards $100,000 has been met with profit-taking, indicating a potential pause in its rally. Ethereum shows positive signs with increased staking activity and a significant price rise in November, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook as it defends key support levels, aiming for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced a sharp decline, highlighting its volatility, although speculative interest remains high. Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, indicating a stable demand for the stablecoin amidst these market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent profit-taking, Bitcoin's proximity to the $100,000 mark and overall market interest suggest potential for further gains, albeit with caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence and potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further gains, supported by positive market forecasts.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price drop and high volatility warrant caution, though speculative interest remains strong. Current holdings suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — While increased issuance supports liquidity, the stablecoin's role as a safe haven remains neutral amidst mixed market signals."
2024-11-24 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with signs of hesitation and profit-taking after recent rallies, particularly for Bitcoin, which saw a pullback after nearing the $100K mark. Ethereum continues to show strength with significant staking inflows and a notable price increase in November, indicating investor confidence. Solana maintains a bullish outlook, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin experiences high volatility and a significant price drop, despite strong speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance has increased, providing liquidity, but the broader market's risk appetite remains cautious, as indicated by the stablecoin's steady demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite nearing $100K, the recent pullback and stalled rally momentum suggest caution. The market is reassessing, and profit-taking is evident.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a 40% increase in November highlight investor confidence and reduced supply, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment persists with key support levels defended and potential for further gains, though recent price decreases warrant a moderate approach.

DOGE: -0.5 — Significant price drop and high volatility, despite speculative interest, indicate a need to reduce exposure and manage risk.

USDT: +0.2 — With market uncertainty and recent asset pullbacks, maintaining some exposure to USDT provides liquidity and stability in the portfolio."
2024-11-24 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, bolstered by increased staking activity, suggesting investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, defending key support levels, while Dogecoin experiences volatility with a recent drop but high speculative interest. Tether continues to support market liquidity with significant new issuance, reflecting its role as a stable liquidity provider in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and high on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to market hesitation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for upward movement, making it an attractive allocation in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent volatility and mixed signals from derivatives demand and price action suggest a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins is prudent, despite its role in supporting market liquidity."
2024-11-24 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent gains in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum facing some resistance. Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark was met with profit-taking, indicating a pause in its rally. Ethereum has shown strong performance in November, bolstered by increased staking activity, which suggests investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels with potential for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, with a notable drop in price despite high speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply, supporting market liquidity, and is involved in potential large-scale Bitcoin-backed loan ventures, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent profit-taking, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and high on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to market hesitation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and significant November gains indicate positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, supporting a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels, along with potential for a breakout, make Solana an attractive allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price drop and volatility, despite high speculative interest, suggest caution and a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — While generally a safe haven, the expansion of USDT supply and its role in supporting market liquidity justify maintaining a moderate allocation to manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a recent rally in Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark but facing resistance as traders take profits. Ethereum has shown strong performance with significant staking inflows and a notable price increase in November, indicating investor confidence. Solana is maintaining key support levels with bullish sentiment persisting, suggesting potential for further gains. Dogecoin has experienced volatility with a recent drop, yet high open interest suggests ongoing speculative interest. Tether's issuance has increased, providing liquidity, while a potential BTC-backed loan venture could impact market dynamics. Overall, the market is showing signs of hesitation and profit-taking, with some assets still displaying bullish potential.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent profit-taking, BTC's approach to $100K and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to market hesitation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase indicate robust investor confidence and reduced circulating supply, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and defense of key support levels suggest potential for further upward movement, with market forecasts targeting higher prices.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent volatility and a drop in price offset by high open interest, indicating speculative interest but no clear directional signal.

USDT: -0.2 — Increased issuance and potential BTC-backed loan venture suggest a supportive role in market liquidity, but a slight reduction in exposure is warranted as risk appetite remains cautious."
2024-11-24 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum shows strong investor confidence with increased staking and a significant price surge in November. Solana maintains bullish sentiment, holding key support levels and aiming for further gains. Dogecoin experiences high volatility with a recent drop, but strong speculative interest remains evident. Tether continues to support market liquidity with significant new issuances and potential large-scale ventures, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to the $100,000 mark and high on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to profit-taking signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a significant price increase in November indicate robust investor confidence and reduced supply, supporting a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment persists with key support levels defended and potential for further price increases, making Solana an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — High volatility and recent price drop counterbalance strong speculative interest, leading to a neutral stance as the market seeks direction.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased market liquidity and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential market gains."
2024-11-24 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back, indicating some profit-taking and reassessment among traders. Ethereum continues to show strength with significant staking inflows, suggesting investor confidence and a reduced circulating supply. Solana is maintaining its bullish momentum, holding key support levels, and is poised for a potential breakout. Dogecoin, despite recent volatility, shows strong speculative interest as indicated by record open interest in derivatives. Meanwhile, Tether's increased issuance supports market liquidity, although it remains a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and high on-chain activity suggest continued interest and potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking inflows and a significant monthly gain indicate robust investor confidence and potential for further upside.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment and technical support at key levels suggest potential for continued upward movement, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative interest is high, recent volatility and lack of clear directional momentum warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased liquidity from new issuance, USDT remains a stable option, but a slight reduction is justified as risk appetite grows in other assets."
2024-11-24 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back due to profit-taking and market hesitation. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a 40% increase in November, supported by increased staking activity. Solana maintains bullish momentum, holding key support levels and aiming for a breakout. Dogecoin experienced significant volatility, with a recent drop but strong speculative interest as indicated by record open interest in derivatives. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity with substantial new issuance, reflecting ongoing demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100,000 and strong on-chain activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong November performance and increased staking activity indicate robust investor confidence and potential for further appreciation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's defense of key support levels and bullish sentiment support a positive outlook, with potential for a breakout above $255.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent volatility and mixed signals from derivatives activity suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-11-24 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 mark before pulling back slightly due to profit-taking and market reassessment. Ethereum has shown strong performance with a significant rise in November and increased staking activity, indicating investor confidence. Solana maintains bullish momentum, holding key support levels and targeting further gains. Dogecoin experienced a sharp drop but remains a focus for speculative trading, as evidenced by record-high open interest. Tether continues to play a crucial role in market liquidity, with substantial new issuance and potential large-scale BTC-backed loan ventures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin's approach to $100K and continued bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains. On-chain activity remains robust.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong price performance and increased staking inflows reflect positive sentiment and reduced supply, supporting a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment persists with SOL defending key support levels and aiming for further upside, supported by technical indicators.
