2024-08-28 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. This downturn is driven by a broader market sell-off and liquidation wave, particularly impacting Bitcoin. Ethereum faces additional pressure from weak investor demand in spot ETFs and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Despite price weaknesses, Solana shows strong user engagement, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin is relatively quiet, with no significant positive developments, while Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the price decline and liquidation-driven sell-off, the increased on-chain activity suggests some underlying interest, warranting a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.3 — The combination of weak ETF demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggests continued downward pressure, justifying a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Although the price is under pressure, the record high in daily active users indicates strong network activity, providing a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant positive developments and ongoing price weakness, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price decreases observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. This downturn is driven by a broader market sell-off, highlighted by Bitcoin's recent liquidation wave and Ethereum's weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows. Despite the price weakness, Solana has shown resilience in terms of user activity, reaching a record high in daily active users. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, suggesting its role as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The market dip and liquidation wave indicate bearish sentiment, and without current holdings, there's no need to reduce exposure further.

ETH: -0.4 — Continued sell pressure from the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand suggest a cautious approach, especially with no current holdings to reduce.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite price struggles, the record high in daily active users provides a slight positive outlook, warranting a cautious hold given existing holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Low activity and lack of significant news or technical signals suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent as it serves as a stable asset amidst volatility."
2024-08-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, driven by liquidation events and macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin has experienced significant liquidations, and Ethereum is facing weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and large sales by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a high level of user activity, is struggling with price weakness, while Dogecoin is dealing with security concerns due to scam alerts. In this environment, USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The market is experiencing a sell-off, with significant liquidations and no bullish technical indicators. The macroeconomic context does not support a strong recovery.

ETH: -0.4 — Weak investor demand and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggest further downside risk, compounded by bearish technical signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite high user activity, Solana's price struggles and potential support retest suggest caution. Holding current exposure is prudent given the mixed signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant positive developments or technical signals to warrant a change in position, especially amidst scam concerns.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing exposure to USDT is advisable as a defensive strategy to preserve capital."
2024-08-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a relatively stable environment, but the recent market corrections indicate a cautious approach is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.1 — Despite recent price increases, Bitcoin faces challenges from energy competition and liquidation-driven sell-offs, suggesting caution.

ETH: -0.2 — Weak investor demand and recent large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate potential downward pressure.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong user activity and potential support levels suggest resilience, but price weakness warrants a moderate approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market caution and recent sell-offs in other assets, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent for stability."
2024-08-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. However, the crypto market is experiencing some turbulence, with Bitcoin facing a liquidation wave and Ethereum seeing significant outflows from spot ETFs, indicating a potential lack of investor confidence. Solana, despite its price struggles, is witnessing high user engagement, which could signal underlying strength. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no major developments, while Tether continues to be stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite a recent price dip and liquidation wave, Bitcoin's on-chain activity remains robust. However, the lack of strong bullish signals and external pressures from AI data centers suggest caution.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is facing headwinds from significant ETF outflows and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation, indicating potential downward pressure despite stable technical indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's record high daily active users indicate strong network activity, which could support price recovery despite recent declines. Current holdings should be maintained with a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant developments and low on-chain activity, Dogecoin remains neutral. The recent scam alert does not appear to impact market sentiment significantly.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and uncertainty, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential downside risks in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent dip in Bitcoin prices driven by a liquidation wave and energy asset acquisitions impacting mining operations. Ethereum faces weak investor demand, highlighted by spot ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows resilience in user activity despite price weakness, indicating potential underlying strength. Dogecoin's environment remains stable but is marred by scam alerts, while Tether remains unaffected by major news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions. Overall, the macroeconomic context suggests a stable environment with moderate volatility, but the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with no strong bullish indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent dip and liquidation wave, there are no strong technical or on-chain signals suggesting a clear directional move. The macro environment remains stable, warranting a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.2 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggest caution. The lack of bullish technical signals supports a slightly negative outlook, especially given no current holdings.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite price weakness, the record daily user activity indicates strong network engagement. Given current holdings, maintaining a positive outlook is justified, though with caution due to broader market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in technicals or sentiment, aside from scam alerts. The lack of strong directional signals supports a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current market uncertainty and lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-08-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, driven by a broader market sell-off impacting major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant liquidations, and Ethereum is facing weak investor demand as indicated by ETF outflows and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a high number of active users, is struggling with price weakness, while Dogecoin is dealing with security concerns due to scam alerts. In this environment, USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent liquidations and a lack of bullish technical signals, Bitcoin's price stability within the Bollinger Bands suggests a hold position. The macroeconomic context does not strongly favor risk-on assets at this time.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate potential further downside. The lack of bullish technical signals supports a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — High daily active users suggest underlying network strength, but price weakness and broader market conditions warrant only a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The absence of bullish technical signals and recent security concerns due to scams suggest maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by a liquidation wave and broader market sell-off. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, exacerbated by external pressures such as AI data centers acquiring energy assets from miners. Ethereum faces weak investor demand, highlighted by spot-ETF outflows and substantial sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite high user activity, is struggling with price weakness, while Dogecoin is dealing with security concerns due to scam alerts. In this environment, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price dip and liquidation wave, there is no clear buy signal from technical indicators, and external pressures remain. Holding a neutral stance is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggest caution. However, there is no immediate need to take a negative stance without current holdings.

SOL: -0.3 — Although Solana shows high user activity, the significant price decline and potential for further downside suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the presence of scam alerts, maintaining a neutral stance is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk, given its stability and lack of negative news."
2024-08-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment reflects a cautious sentiment with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a significant dip due to liquidation pressures and external factors such as energy demands from AI data centers. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand, as evidenced by spot ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite price weakness, shows strong network activity with record daily usage, suggesting underlying strength. Dogecoin's market is relatively quiet, with minor price movements and a scam alert affecting sentiment. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its continued role as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — The recent liquidation wave and external pressures suggest caution, though the absence of a current position limits downside risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate potential downside, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite price weakness, strong network activity and user engagement support a positive outlook, justifying increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Limited activity and absence of significant news maintain a neutral stance, with no current holdings to adjust.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of broader market caution, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with recent volatility and liquidation events impacting Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a significant liquidation wave, causing a dip below $58k, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand, as evidenced by spot ETF outflows and large selloffs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a recent price drop, shows strong on-chain activity with record daily active users, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is marred by scam alerts. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option amid market uncertainties, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidation-driven price dips, Bitcoin's recovery in the last hour and bullish momentum suggest a cautious buy signal.

ETH: -0.1 — Weak investor demand and large selloffs by the Ethereum Foundation weigh on sentiment, suggesting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and record user engagement provide a positive outlook despite recent price weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, with scam alerts being the only noteworthy news.

USDT: -0.4 — While USDT remains stable, the recent recovery in crypto prices suggests a slight rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-08-28 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin experienced a significant liquidation event, driving its price below $58k, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by spot ETF outflows and a large sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a price decline, shows robust on-chain activity with record daily active users. Dogecoin's sentiment is neutral to slightly negative due to a scam alert, while Tether remains stable without significant news. Overall, the market is experiencing volatility, with some assets showing resilience in on-chain activity despite price pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation events and energy concerns from AI data centers create a bearish outlook. However, on-chain activity remains robust, mitigating a stronger sell signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum in recent hours, the large sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation and ETF outflows indicate weak investor confidence, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage suggest underlying strength despite recent price weakness, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The scam alert creates caution, but no significant changes in technicals or sentiment justify a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market volatility and bearish signals from other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a defensive position."
2024-08-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with significant price fluctuations and varying momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a notable price increase, but recent news of liquidation waves and energy asset acquisitions by tech firms may introduce volatility. Ethereum shows bullish momentum, although recent ETF outflows and large sales by the Ethereum Foundation suggest investor caution. Solana's on-chain activity remains robust despite price weakness, indicating strong user engagement. Dogecoin's market activity is subdued, with recent scam alerts potentially affecting sentiment. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price increases and bullish momentum, news of liquidation waves and energy asset acquisitions may introduce volatility. Maintain a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — Bullish momentum is countered by significant ETF outflows and large sales by the Ethereum Foundation, suggesting potential downside risk.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and user engagement provide a positive outlook, despite recent price weakness. Consider increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Limited market activity and recent scam alerts suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signals for allocation changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment in other assets, maintain some exposure to USDT for stability, but consider slight reduction as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery despite recent liquidation-driven dips. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors. Ethereum faces headwinds from ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation, indicating potential short-term weakness. Solana, despite a recent price drop, shows strong on-chain activity and user engagement, which could support a rebound. Dogecoin remains largely unaffected by market movements, with no significant news impacting its sentiment. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent dips, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity suggest a potential recovery. The macro environment supports a moderate risk-on approach.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued sell pressure from the Ethereum Foundation and ETF outflows indicate potential short-term weakness, warranting caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and user engagement, despite price weakness, suggest a potential rebound. The asset remains attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position. No clear signals for allocation adjustments.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with growth potential."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, driven by a recent wave of liquidations impacting Bitcoin and broader market sell-offs. Bitcoin's price has seen a dip below $58k, influenced by liquidation pressures and energy resource reallocations. Ethereum faces weak investor demand, as evidenced by spot-ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, though vigilance is needed due to scam alerts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, suggesting a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy resource competition create a bearish outlook. Current holdings suggest a cautious reduction.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with weak ETF demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. No current holdings, so no reduction needed.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage provide a bullish counterbalance to recent price weakness. Maintain current exposure with a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in market data or sentiment. Scam alerts warrant caution, but no current holdings mean no reduction is necessary.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the market's cautious sentiment and recent sell-offs, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for capital preservation is prudent."
2024-08-28 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a recent dip in Bitcoin driven by liquidation events and energy asset acquisitions affecting mining operations. Ethereum is experiencing weak investor demand, highlighted by significant outflows from spot ETFs and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows strong user engagement despite price weakness, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains stable but is marred by scam alerts, while Tether remains neutral with no significant news. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation-driven dip and energy concerns suggest caution. Despite bullish momentum, the market sentiment is mixed, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation create uncertainty, balancing out the bullish momentum signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite price weakness, record user engagement and activity suggest underlying strength, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, with scam alerts neutralizing any positive momentum signals.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and recent volatility, maintaining a moderate stablecoin position provides a hedge against potential downside risks."
2024-08-28 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a significant liquidation wave, causing a dip below $58,000, while Ethereum is facing weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and a large sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong user engagement, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin is relatively stable, though it faces security concerns due to scam alerts. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious approach may be prudent, with some capital remaining in stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent liquidation wave and energy concerns from AI data centers suggest potential further downside. Reducing exposure seems prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with weak investor demand and large sell-offs counterbalanced by bullish momentum. A neutral stance is appropriate until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite price weakness, the record daily usage indicates strong underlying demand. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment beyond scam alerts. Maintaining a neutral position is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish signals in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bearish, with recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by liquidation events and weak investor demand. Bitcoin faces additional pressure from energy resource reallocation to AI data centers, while Ethereum is seeing significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a significant drop in price, shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin's market remains stable but is marred by scam alerts, while Tether remains steady with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent liquidation wave and energy resource pressures suggest a bearish outlook. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current macroeconomic and market conditions.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the bullish technical indicators, the significant sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation and ETF outflows suggest caution. Holding a neutral position is advisable.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the price decline, Solana's record daily usage indicates underlying strength. A slight increase in allocation is justified by strong on-chain activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in market data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate, especially given the recent scam alerts.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment in the broader market, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven amidst volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and a relatively low VIX, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin has experienced a significant liquidation event, contributing to a broader market sell-off. Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and large sales by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite price weakness, shows strong user engagement, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant developments affecting its price, while USDT continues to serve as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and energy concerns are weighing on Bitcoin, suggesting a cautious approach despite bullish momentum signals.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but negative sentiment from ETF outflows and large sales by the Ethereum Foundation, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and record user engagement provide a positive outlook, despite recent price declines, indicating potential for a rebound.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market volatility and Bitcoin's recent sell-off, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against further downside risk."
2024-08-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a mix of bullish momentum and some bearish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a recovery in price despite recent liquidation events and competition for energy resources from AI data centers. Ethereum shows strong technical momentum, but investor sentiment is dampened by significant outflows from spot ETFs and sales by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana is witnessing high on-chain activity, indicating strong user engagement, but its price remains under pressure. Dogecoin has seen a price increase, but there are concerns about scams affecting its community. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite recent liquidations, Bitcoin shows strong price recovery and bullish momentum. However, competition for energy resources may pose a longer-term challenge.

**ETH: +0.3** — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but recent sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and ETF outflows suggest caution. The score reflects a moderate buy signal.

**SOL: +0.2** — Solana's high on-chain activity is a positive sign, but price weakness and potential support retests warrant a cautious approach.

**DOGE: 0.0** — While Dogecoin has shown a price increase, the lack of significant positive developments and concerns about scams keep the signal neutral.

**USDT: -0.3** — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets."
2024-08-28 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some assets showing bullish momentum despite recent price volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a significant liquidation event, contributing to a price dip, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and a large sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong user engagement, indicating underlying network strength. Dogecoin is dealing with security concerns due to a scam alert, which may affect investor confidence. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indicators, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation and energy concerns weigh on sentiment, despite bullish momentum signals. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.2 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation create a cautious outlook, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong user engagement and network activity provide a positive outlook despite price weakness, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Security concerns from scam alerts offset bullish momentum, leading to a neutral stance with no current holdings to reduce.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a stable position in USDT provides a buffer against volatility, suggesting a slight increase in allocation."
2024-08-28 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a dip due to a significant liquidation wave, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by spot ETF outflows and a large selloff by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana is seeing record daily usage despite a price drop, indicating strong network activity. Dogecoin's market remains relatively stable, though a scam alert has been issued. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, which could support a cautious approach to risk assets. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious with potential for selective opportunities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly, but maintain a position due to potential recovery.

ETH: -0.1 — The selloff by the Ethereum Foundation and ETF outflows indicate weak demand. Maintain a cautious stance, but hold due to ongoing bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong network activity with record daily usage supports a modest increase in allocation, despite recent price weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment. Maintain a neutral stance given the lack of current holdings and recent scam alert.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential for further volatility, slightly increase stablecoin exposure to manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish momentum signals across several cryptocurrencies, despite some recent volatility and liquidation events. Bitcoin has shown a slight recovery in price, but faces external pressures from energy asset reallocations. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant outflows from spot ETFs and sales by the Ethereum Foundation, indicating potential investor caution. Solana maintains strong user activity despite a recent price dip, suggesting underlying network strength. Dogecoin remains stable, with no significant changes in sentiment or activity. Tether remains a stable anchor with no major news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidations, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. However, external pressures from energy reallocations warrant caution.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows and sales by the Ethereum Foundation, indicating potential for further downside despite bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user activity and bullish momentum suggest resilience, even as the price faces pressure. The network's robust usage metrics support a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators. The market remains stable with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.2 — As risk appetite cautiously increases, there may be a slight rotation out of stablecoins like USDT, but maintaining some exposure is prudent given market uncertainties."
2024-08-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with bearish undertones. Bitcoin is experiencing a dip driven by a wave of liquidations and external pressures from AI data centers acquiring energy assets, which could impact mining operations. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand, as evidenced by significant outflows from spot ETFs and the Ethereum Foundation's large sell-off. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong user engagement with record daily activity. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, though it faces minor negative sentiment due to a scam alert. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The liquidation wave and external pressures on mining operations suggest potential further downside. Holding current positions while reducing exposure seems prudent.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate bearish sentiment. Reducing exposure is advisable.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price weakness, strong user engagement and activity provide a slight positive outlook. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven is recommended."
2024-08-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent volatility and liquidation events impacting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip below $58k, driven by a wave of liquidations, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by spot-ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong user engagement, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is marred by scam alerts. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, with a potential preference for stability in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, recent liquidation events and energy asset acquisitions by tech firms suggest potential headwinds. Current holdings warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand indicate bearish sentiment. Reducing exposure is prudent given these developments.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong user engagement and a potential support level around $127 provide some optimism, though price weakness persists. A modest increase in allocation is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in market data or sentiment, aside from scam alerts. Maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for further volatility, increasing stablecoin exposure provides a hedge against downside risk."
2024-08-29 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which can be supportive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum despite a lack of a clear trend signal, while Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is seeing increased user activity, which could be a positive sign for future growth, especially with potential Binance integration. Dogecoin has received a boost from legal clarity, and Tether remains a stable reserve asset with strong backing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a clear trend signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant move due to macroeconomic factors warrant a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is tempered by resistance at $2,700, suggesting a cautious approach with a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide strong support for Solana, making it the most attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.1 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive developments in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets, reflecting increased risk appetite."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. dollar index is stable, and there are no significant shifts in gold or oil prices. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows bullish momentum, but analysts warn of potential price shocks due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum faces resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is experiencing high user activity, which could be a positive signal, especially with potential Binance integration. Dogecoin's legal clarity with the dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk may provide some stability. Tether's strong reserve position enhances its reliability as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite warnings of potential price shocks, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic uncertainties.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations limit the upside potential. A cautious buy is recommended.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration provide strong bullish sentiment. Despite price stagnation, the fundamentals support a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides stability, but there are no significant changes in market data or sentiment to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets and stable macro conditions, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is justified to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-08-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing bullish momentum but lacking a strong trend signal. Ethereum is facing resistance, and while it maintains bullish momentum, a significant breakout is not expected in the immediate term. Solana is seeing increased user activity, which is a positive sign, although its price remains stagnant. Dogecoin has seen a legal win with the dismissal of a lawsuit, which could bolster sentiment. Tether remains stable with strong reserve backing, indicating trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of a strong trend signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors warrant a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: +0.1 — Ethereum maintains bullish momentum, but resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations suggest only a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased daily active users and potential integration with Binance provide a strong case for a positive allocation, despite current price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk could improve sentiment, supporting a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is prudent as other assets show more potential for growth."
2024-08-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, with the S&P 500 maintaining a high level, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum despite a lack of a strong buy signal from trend indicators, and analysts warn of potential price shocks due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see a significant breakout until later in the year. Solana is seeing increased user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin has seen a legal victory with the dismissal of a lawsuit, which might stabilize sentiment. Tether's reserves are strong, reinforcing trust in its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a trend buy signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors warrant a moderately positive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum is facing resistance, its consistent bullish momentum and strong technicals suggest a slight positive bias, although a major breakout is not imminent.

SOL: +0.6 — The increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration provide strong positive sentiment, making Solana an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit provides stability, but there are no significant catalysts for a directional move, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market showing signs of bullish momentum and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."
2024-08-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance. Cryptocurrencies are showing mixed signals: Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum but lacks a strong trend signal, while Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is seeing increased user activity, which could be a positive indicator despite its price stagnation. Dogecoin has been buoyed by positive legal news, while Tether remains stable with strong reserve backing. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement in some assets but also significant resistance and uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Bitcoin shows bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting potential for upward movement. However, the lack of a strong trend signal tempers the enthusiasm.

**ETH: +0.2** — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and may not see significant price action soon. The score reflects cautious optimism.

**SOL: +0.6** — Solana's increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration are positive indicators, suggesting it may outperform in the near term.

**DOGE: +0.3** — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, providing a slight positive sentiment boost.

**USDT: 0.0** — With no current holdings and stable market conditions, there is no strong signal to either increase or decrease exposure to USDT."
2024-08-29 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a general upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite some resistance levels. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, although analysts warn of potential volatility due to macroeconomic factors such as Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance but maintains bullish technical indicators. Solana is seeing increased user activity and speculation around potential new integrations, which could support its price. Dogecoin has received a boost from the dismissal of a major lawsuit, while Tether remains stable with strong reserve backing, indicating trust in its solvency. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a relatively stable risk appetite, supporting a cautious shift towards risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite potential volatility warnings, Bitcoin's strong bullish momentum and on-chain activity suggest a favorable environment for price appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — While facing resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical indicators warrant a moderate positive outlook, though less aggressive than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a positive catalyst, supporting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, providing a slight positive sentiment boost.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the stable macro environment and strong reserve backing, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent as risk appetite remains moderate."
2024-08-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is showing upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic influences such as U.S. Federal Reserve liquidity injections. Ethereum, while facing resistance, maintains a bullish momentum signal, though a significant breakout may be delayed. Solana is experiencing increased user activity, which could be a positive indicator despite its price stagnation. Dogecoin's legal clarity with the dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk could stabilize its market perception. Tether remains robust with strong reserve backing, providing confidence in its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic catalysts suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum's consistent bullish momentum and technical indicators support a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration news provide a positive outlook, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal clarity from the lawsuit dismissal and continued bullish momentum suggest a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current bullish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate to allow for potential capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-08-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. The cryptocurrency market is showing mixed signals, with Bitcoin experiencing bullish momentum despite low on-chain activity and a potential price shock due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance and might not see significant upward movement soon. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and potential integration news, which could bolster its appeal. Dogecoin has seen a legal win, which might stabilize sentiment, while Tether remains a safe haven with strong reserve backing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite low on-chain activity, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but resistance levels and news suggest a neutral stance for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong user activity and potential Binance integration provide a bullish outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal clarity and bullish momentum support a slight positive bias, but no strong catalysts for a major move.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX index. The cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin maintaining bullish momentum despite low on-chain activity, and Ethereum facing resistance but still showing positive technical indicators. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users, which could indicate future growth potential, especially with potential Binance integration. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, while Tether's strong reserve backing enhances its stability. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement in select assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows bullish momentum and a potential for a price shock due to macroeconomic factors. However, low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and technical indicators, suggesting potential for future growth.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration are positive signals, indicating strong growth potential.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, and bullish momentum supports a modest positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-08-29 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is showing signs of bullish momentum, particularly for BTC and ETH, with consistent buy signals from technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing low on-chain activity but maintains strong momentum, while Ethereum faces resistance but remains stable. Solana is seeing a surge in user activity, which could be a precursor to price movements, especially with potential Binance integration. Dogecoin has seen positive sentiment following the dismissal of a major lawsuit, and USDT remains stable with strong reserve backing. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement in several assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite low on-chain activity, BTC shows strong technical momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors. 

ETH: +0.3 — While facing resistance, ETH maintains bullish momentum and stability, making it a moderate buy in the current environment.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased user activity and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from the lawsuit dismissal and consistent buy signals suggest a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market optimism, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT as a hedge against volatility is prudent."
2024-08-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by positive technical indicators and speculation of a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum, while maintaining bullish momentum, faces resistance and may not see a substantial breakout until later in the year. Solana is gaining traction with increased user activity and potential integration with Binance, suggesting positive sentiment. Dogecoin's sentiment is neutral to positive following the dismissal of a major lawsuit, while Tether remains stable with strong reserve backing, indicating trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move, supported by macroeconomic factors and technical indicators. This makes it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Although Ethereum faces resistance, it maintains bullish momentum and remains a solid asset in the portfolio. However, its potential is somewhat limited in the short term.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana benefits from increased user activity and potential Binance integration, suggesting a positive outlook. The asset shows strong momentum and is deserving of increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, and the asset maintains bullish momentum. However, the lack of major catalysts keeps the score moderate.

USDT: 0.0 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is no immediate need to hold USDT. However, maintaining a neutral position allows for flexibility in case of market volatility."
2024-08-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum faces resistance, its technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting a moderate allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's high user activity and potential Binance integration provide a strong bullish case, making it a favorable asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive legal news and bullish momentum support a slight increase in allocation, though the asset remains less attractive compared to others.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as the market shows a preference for riskier assets."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum and potential for significant price movements due to macroeconomic factors such as U.S. Federal Reserve liquidity injections. Ethereum, while also experiencing bullish momentum, faces resistance and might not see major upward movements until later in the year. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users, indicating strong network activity, and potential integration with Binance could further boost its appeal. Dogecoin has seen a positive development with the dismissal of a major lawsuit, which could stabilize sentiment around the asset. Tether remains stable, with strong reserve backing, but in a bullish market, capital may rotate out of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors make Bitcoin highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite bullish momentum, resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations limit aggressive allocation, though it remains a positive hold.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a strong case for increased allocation, supported by consistent bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.1 — Positive legal news stabilizes sentiment, but without strong bullish signals, only a slight increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT remains stable with strong reserves, the bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation."
2024-08-29 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and momentum signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by strong on-chain activity and a possible price shock due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, delaying its potential breakout. Solana is seeing increased user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could drive interest. Dogecoin has gained some positive sentiment following the dismissal of a major lawsuit. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with strong reserve backing, indicating trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with consistent buy signals and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors. The potential for a price shock adds to its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. However, the delay in a breakout tempers enthusiasm, leading to a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana benefits from increased daily active users and potential Binance integration, suggesting a favorable outlook despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.1 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a slight positive sentiment boost, but overall technicals remain stable.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive momentum in riskier assets, there is a preference to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by increased on-chain activity, though analysts warn of possible volatility due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum faces resistance, with a breakout potentially delayed, while Solana benefits from increased user activity and potential integration with Binance. Dogecoin sees a legal win, which could stabilize sentiment, but lacks strong momentum. USDT remains stable, supported by strong reserve data, but may see reduced demand if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest a bullish outlook, though macroeconomic warnings warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum signals, but the potential delay in a breakout tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments with increased user activity and potential Binance integration support a favorable outlook, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal news may stabilize sentiment, but the lack of significant momentum or technical changes keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted."
2024-08-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with strong technical indicators such as buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum from MACD across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing potential volatility due to anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve actions, which could lead to significant price movements. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, delaying a potential breakout. Solana is seeing increased user activity and speculation around new integrations, which could drive future interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, and Tether maintains strong reserve backing, enhancing trust in its stability. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility, supports a cautiously optimistic outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential volatility from macroeconomic factors, strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — While facing resistance, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, and the overall market environment supports a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong user activity and potential new integrations provide a compelling case for increased allocation, supported by positive technical signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Benefiting from positive legal news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin warrants a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent to allow for capital rotation into riskier assets."
2024-08-29 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators, such as short-term moving averages above long-term ones and positive MACD signals. However, recent price volatility, particularly the significant price decreases in the last hour, suggests potential short-term instability. Macroeconomic factors, including stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, provide a relatively neutral backdrop. News highlights include potential price shocks for Bitcoin due to Federal Reserve actions, Ethereum's delayed breakout expectations, and Solana's increasing user activity and potential Binance integration. The dismissal of a major lawsuit against Elon Musk regarding Dogecoin has removed a potential overhang for DOGE, while Tether's strong reserve report boosts confidence in its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, bullish technical indicators and potential for a significant move due to macroeconomic factors suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with technicals remaining bullish but news indicating a delayed breakout. Holding current position seems prudent.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user activity and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, despite recent price declines. Increased allocation is justified.

DOGE: +0.1 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a negative overhang, but technicals are less compelling. A slight increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market sentiment leaning towards cautious optimism, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets is advisable."
2024-08-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies shows mixed signals with some assets experiencing significant price fluctuations. Bitcoin shows potential for a major price move due to macroeconomic factors, while Ethereum struggles with resistance levels. Solana's user activity is at a high, indicating strong network engagement, and Dogecoin has seen legal clarity with the dismissal of a lawsuit. Tether remains a stable option with strong reserve backing, as confirmed by Bitget's proof-of-reserves.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price volatility, the potential for a major price move due to macroeconomic factors and bullish technical indicators suggests a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing resistance and lacks strong momentum, with analysts predicting a delayed breakout, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration are positive signals, suggesting increased interest and potential future price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, providing a slight positive sentiment boost.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally risk-on sentiment and the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted."
2024-08-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, BTC shows bullish momentum and potential for a significant price movement due to macroeconomic factors. The overall sentiment remains positive, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing resistance and lacks strong momentum signals. The market anticipates a delayed breakout, suggesting a hold position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — High user activity and potential Binance integration are positive indicators. However, the lack of price movement tempers enthusiasm, warranting a cautious buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides some stability, but there are no strong technical or momentum signals to drive a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a slight increase in risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, it is reasonable to reduce exposure to stablecoins, though maintaining some level of stability in the portfolio is prudent."
2024-08-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. Bitcoin's market is experiencing a potential for significant price movement due to anticipated Federal Reserve actions, which could lead to volatility. Ethereum faces resistance and might not see significant upward movement until later in the year. Solana is experiencing a high in daily active users, suggesting strong network activity despite price stagnation. Dogecoin has seen a legal win with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, potentially stabilizing sentiment. USDT maintains strong reserve backing, enhancing trust in its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, the potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors and strong on-chain activity suggests a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing resistance and lacks immediate bullish momentum. It is prudent to hold until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong network activity with a high in daily active users and potential Binance integration suggests a moderate buy signal despite price stagnation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit provides stability, but there is no significant bullish momentum or technical indicators to warrant a change in position.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for increased volatility and the attractiveness of other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential market movements."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting positive sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto markets. Bitcoin is experiencing mixed signals with a potential for significant price movement due to anticipated Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum faces resistance, delaying potential breakouts. Solana is showing strong user engagement, which could be a positive indicator despite recent price stagnation. Dogecoin has cleared legal hurdles, potentially boosting investor confidence. Tether's strong reserve backing enhances its appeal as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical indicators, the potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors warrants a cautious positive stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations suggest a neutral position until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user engagement and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, despite current price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Legal clarity from the lawsuit dismissal offers a slight positive, but technicals remain neutral.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the potential for upward movement in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-29 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows potential for a significant price movement due to macroeconomic factors, specifically potential liquidity injections by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see a breakout until later in the year. Solana is experiencing positive user activity, reaching a new high in daily active users, which could signal underlying strength despite price stagnation. Dogecoin has received a boost in sentiment following the dismissal of a major lawsuit against Elon Musk. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with strong reserve backing, indicating trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Potential for significant price movement due to macroeconomic factors, though technical indicators are mixed. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Facing resistance with no immediate breakout expected. Hold current position as technicals and news suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong user activity and potential new developments with Binance suggest underlying strength. Increase exposure slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from legal news, but technicals remain neutral. Slightly increase exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current exposure as a hedge against volatility, given the stable macroeconomic environment and strong reserve backing."
2024-08-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a slight dip below $60K amid U.S. session weakness, but large wallets continue to accumulate, suggesting a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum shows signs of volatility with some strategic movements by its co-founder, indicating cautious optimism. Solana is experiencing increased network activity and adoption, driven by a surge in daily active users and interest in Solana-native memecoins. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, leaving their market positions relatively unchanged. The macroeconomic context is stable, with moderate volatility and no extreme shifts in major indices, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price dip, the accumulation by large wallets suggests a potential bullish setup. The overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are neutral, and recent strategic moves by Vitalik Buterin suggest a wait-and-see approach. The market is still debating its direction, so a hold position is appropriate.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record surge in daily active users and the memecoin wave highlight its growing adoption and network strength. This positive momentum supports a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains in a neutral position. The lack of new developments suggests holding the current allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautious optimism in the market and the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin trading in a tight range and experiencing mixed signals from different regions. While large Bitcoin holders are accumulating, suggesting a potential bullish foundation, the price remains under pressure, particularly during U.S. trading hours. Ethereum is experiencing some volatility, with notable movements by its co-founder, but lacks strong bullish momentum. Solana is showing signs of increased network activity and adoption, driven by a surge in daily active users and interest in memecoins. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a relatively stable environment for these assets. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the price dip, the accumulation by large holders suggests underlying strength, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent sell pressure and founder activity; no clear directional bias at this time.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user growth provide a bullish case, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data suggests maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautious optimism in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-30 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin trading in a tight range and showing signs of accumulation by large holders, which suggests a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals, with notable movements by its co-founder and discussions around network activity versus broader interest. Solana is witnessing a surge in daily active users and memecoin activity, highlighting its network's strengths. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable environment for these assets. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish setup. The macroeconomic environment is stable, supporting a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent co-founder movements and debates on network activity. The lack of clear bullish momentum keeps the allocation neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user growth, combined with its competitive edge in transaction speed and cost, justify a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in market data. Maintain current exposure without increasing or decreasing allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a potential shift towards riskier assets like BTC and SOL, reduce stablecoin exposure slightly to capitalize on potential market gains."
2024-08-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.0. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a mixed sentiment, with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders, which could indicate a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips. Ethereum is facing mixed signals with notable transactions by its co-founder, while Solana is witnessing a surge in network activity, highlighting its growing adoption. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, suggesting a relatively stable outlook for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large wallets suggests a potential bullish foundation, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from recent transactions by Vitalik Buterin and ongoing volatility suggest maintaining the current position without changes.

SOL: +0.5 — The record surge in daily active users and network adoption highlights Solana's potential, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable market data suggest maintaining the current position without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential bullish signals in BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities in these assets."
2024-08-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight declines in price over the past few hours. Bitcoin is trading within a tight range, with large holders continuing to accumulate, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite current price weakness. Ethereum's market activity is mixed, with notable transactions by co-founder Vitalik Buterin, but broader interest seems to be waning. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users, highlighting its growing adoption and network strengths. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, maintaining their current market positions. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, which could support a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish setup. However, the lack of immediate technical buy signals warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's mixed signals, with recent transactions by a key figure and ongoing volatility, suggest a hold position as the market seeks direction.

SOL: +0.5 — The record surge in daily active users and the network's strengths in handling high-speed, low-cost transactions make Solana relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral, reflecting its stable but unremarkable position in the market.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and the absence of strong buy signals across other assets, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT could provide a buffer against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.0, and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index at 101.7. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders, which could indicate a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips. Ethereum's market activity is influenced by Vitalik Buterin's transactions, though overall sentiment remains cautious. Solana is witnessing increased network activity and adoption, driven by its high-speed and low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, but Dogecoin's technical indicators show some bullish momentum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests potential for a bullish turnaround. The macro environment remains supportive with low volatility.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are neutral, the network's resilience and Buterin's strategic moves provide a slight positive bias. However, caution is warranted due to mixed market reactions.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and adoption, highlighted by record daily active users, make Solana attractive. Its technical indicators are neutral, but the fundamental growth is compelling.

DOGE: +0.1 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators provides a slight positive bias, though lack of significant news keeps the outlook cautious.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish signals in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT aligns with a strategy to capitalize on riskier assets' potential upside."
2024-08-30 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility in the broader market, with the S&P 500 maintaining a strong position. Bitcoin is experiencing a tug-of-war between Asian buying and U.S. selling, but large holders are accumulating, suggesting a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum's market is reacting to significant movements by its co-founder, while Solana is seeing increased network activity and user adoption, highlighted by a surge in daily active users. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a stable but uneventful position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish trend, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

ETH: +0.2 — While there is some market reaction to Vitalik Buterin's transactions, the rebound from recent lows and ongoing network activity provide a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — The record surge in daily active users and the network's growing adoption highlight Solana's strong position, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential bullish signals in other assets, maintaining a lower exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of slight price increases and some bullish signals, particularly in assets like DOGE and SOL. Bitcoin's price remains volatile, trading below $60K, but large holders are accumulating, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Ethereum's market activity is mixed, with notable on-chain movements by its co-founder, which may indicate caution. Solana is experiencing strong network activity and user growth, driven by new memecoin interest, indicating a positive outlook. Meanwhile, DOGE shows some bullish momentum, though without significant news to drive a strong narrative. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indices, which might support a risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish foundation. The macro context is stable, which could support a gradual increase in BTC exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent on-chain activity by Vitalik Buterin and no clear bullish momentum. Holding current exposure seems prudent until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user growth, alongside bullish sentiment from memecoin activity, make Solana attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Some bullish momentum is observed, though lacking significant news. A slight increase in exposure could be justified by the technical indicators.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential for risk-on behavior, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of other assets is advisable."
2024-08-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

SOL: +0.6 — Record daily active users and memecoin activity highlight strong network growth, supporting a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators, but lack of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted."
2024-08-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips below $60K. Ethereum's market activity is stable, with notable transactions by its co-founder but lacking strong bullish signals. Solana is experiencing increased network activity and adoption, driven by a surge in daily active users and interest in memecoins, highlighting its competitive edge. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, with Dogecoin showing some bullish momentum in technical indicators. Overall, the macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a cautious but potentially optimistic outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders and bullish momentum signals suggest a potential upward trend. The macroeconomic stability supports a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are neutral, and recent transactions by its co-founder do not provide a clear directional signal. Holding the current position is advisable.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record surge in daily active users and memecoin activity highlights its growing adoption and network strength, warranting an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, the bullish momentum in technical indicators suggests a slight positive bias, justifying a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally stable macro environment and positive signals in other assets, reducing USDT exposure slightly to reallocate capital to more promising assets is advisable."
2024-08-30 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips below $60K. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals, with notable activity from its co-founder and a rebound from recent lows, but it remains under broader market pressure. Solana is gaining traction with record daily active users and increased network adoption, driven by its high-speed, low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, with Dogecoin maintaining bullish technical indicators. Overall, the market is showing resilience, with some assets displaying stronger bullish signals than others.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders and bullish momentum signal a potential upward trend, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with sideways technicals and recent sell pressure from a co-founder; no clear directional bias at this time.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and bullish momentum, combined with positive news on user growth, support a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish technical indicators suggest potential upward movement, though lacking significant news, it remains a moderate buy.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is advised."
2024-08-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-08-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with recent significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL, indicating potential bearish pressure. However, there are some bullish undercurrents, such as large BTC holders accumulating more coins, which could provide a foundation for future price stability or growth. Ethereum's on-chain activity remains robust despite recent volatility, and Solana is experiencing increased network usage and adoption, particularly driven by memecoin activity. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility, suggesting that external factors are not currently exerting significant pressure on crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, the accumulation by large holders and bullish momentum signals suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to the recent breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum shows mixed signals with recent price declines and Vitalik Buterin's movements potentially impacting sentiment. On-chain activity remains strong, but the overall market pressure suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record daily active users and memecoin-driven adoption highlight its growing ecosystem, suggesting a favorable outlook despite recent price declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. The lack of major developments keeps it in a hold position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the recent market volatility and price drops in other assets, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT could provide a buffer against further downside risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.0. The U.S. dollar index is slightly lower, which can be supportive for cryptocurrencies. The recent market data shows a mixed picture with significant price decreases across BTC, ETH, and SOL, indicating potential bearish sentiment. However, BTC's large wallet accumulation suggests underlying bullish support. Ethereum's network activity remains robust, but recent sell-offs have impacted sentiment. Solana is experiencing increased network adoption, which is a positive sign despite recent price declines. Dogecoin shows some technical strength with a buy signal, but lacks significant news to drive momentum. USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, large wallet accumulation suggests potential for a bullish reversal. The overall market sentiment remains cautious, but BTC's underlying support is noteworthy.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with recent sell-offs offsetting positive network activity. The market is waiting for clearer signals before committing capital.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's record daily-active-user count and network adoption are strong positives, suggesting potential for price recovery despite recent declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators show some strength, the lack of significant news or developments keeps sentiment neutral.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the recent market volatility and price declines in other assets, maintaining some exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent."
2024-08-30 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some signs of recovery after recent declines. Bitcoin is showing resilience with large wallet accumulation, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips. Ethereum is experiencing volatility, with notable on-chain activity but mixed sentiment due to co-founder Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions. Solana is seeing increased network activity and adoption, driven by a surge in daily active users and interest in its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable position in the current market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large wallets suggests a potential bullish outlook. This, combined with a slight recovery in price, supports a moderate buy signal.

**ETH: 0.0** — Mixed signals from technical indicators and recent activity by Vitalik Buterin create uncertainty. The lack of a clear directional trend suggests a hold position.

**SOL: +0.6** — Strong network activity and increased user adoption highlight Solana's potential. The positive news and technical indicators support a higher allocation.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains in a neutral position.

**USDT: -0.3** — As risk appetite seems to be increasing, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with notable bearish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, which have experienced significant price declines and technical indicators suggesting potential breakdowns. However, there are signs of resilience, such as large BTC holders accumulating more coins, which could indicate a potential bullish foundation. Solana has shown strong network adoption with record daily active users, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Meanwhile, DOGE and USDT remain relatively stable, with no significant news impacting their positions. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.1 — Despite recent price declines, the accumulation by large holders suggests potential for a rebound. However, technical indicators remain weak, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price declines and Vitalik Buterin's movements causing market reactions. The lack of clear bullish momentum keeps the outlook neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network growth and adoption, coupled with bullish news on user activity, make Solana relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market uncertainty and lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining some exposure to USDT provides a safe haven for capital preservation."
2024-08-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation. The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, supporting a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent price rebound and network activity are positive, though mixed sentiment due to Vitalik's recent transactions tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record surge in daily active users and memecoin activity highlights strong network growth and adoption, warranting a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, DOGE's price increase aligns with the broader market trend, justifying a slight positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing some weakness as it dips below $60K, primarily due to U.S. session sell-offs. However, large wallets are accumulating BTC, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Ethereum has shown some recovery, but recent actions by Vitalik Buterin and ongoing volatility suggest caution. Solana is experiencing positive momentum, driven by increased daily active users and interest in its ecosystem's low-cost, high-speed capabilities. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, with Dogecoin showing low activity levels. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish foundation, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and recent moves by Vitalik Buterin suggest a hold position, as the market digests these developments.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network activity and positive sentiment around Solana's ecosystem support an increased allocation, reflecting its growing adoption.

DOGE: -0.1 — Low activity and lack of significant news indicate a slight reduction in exposure, aligning with the current portfolio status.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market signals and potential volatility, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins for risk management is prudent."
2024-08-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing a range-bound movement between $58K and $59K, with large wallets accumulating, which suggests a potential bullish foundation despite recent dips. Ethereum has shown some recovery from its recent lows, but the market remains cautious due to mixed signals from on-chain activity and Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions. Solana is seeing increased adoption with a record surge in daily active users, highlighting its strengths in high-speed, low-cost transactions. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, indicating stable conditions without major catalysts. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a relatively stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, suggests a cautious risk environment, favoring stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large wallets suggests potential for upward movement. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recovery and on-chain activity provide some positive signals, but mixed sentiment from recent transactions by Vitalik Buterin tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and increased daily active users highlight Solana's potential, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data suggests a neutral stance, with no clear signals for allocation changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the potential for bullish movement in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly could be beneficial to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-30 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a tug-of-war between accumulation by large holders and selling pressure in the U.S. market, keeping it in a tight range below $60K. Ethereum is seeing some strategic movements by its co-founder, which has not significantly impacted its price, but the network's activity remains a point of interest. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and memecoin activity, highlighting its growing adoption and network strengths. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, with Dogecoin showing low on-chain activity. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no extreme shifts in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the price dip, large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While there is no strong buy signal, the network's activity and strategic moves by key figures suggest potential for growth, justifying a slight increase.

SOL: +0.6 — The record surge in daily active users and memecoin activity underscores Solana's adoption potential, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and low on-chain activity, there is no clear signal to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for growth in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is prudent to capitalize on risk assets."
2024-08-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish undertones. Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range, with large holders accumulating, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent dips below $60K. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with a recent rebound, but mixed signals from Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions have created some uncertainty. Solana is experiencing strong network adoption, highlighted by record daily active users and a surge in memecoin activity, indicating robust growth potential. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows some positive momentum in recent trading data. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a bullish outlook. The overall market sentiment and on-chain activity support a moderate increase in allocation.

**ETH: +0.3** — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, with bullish momentum and network activity rebounding. However, recent transactions by Vitalik Buterin introduce some caution, warranting a moderate but not aggressive increase.

**SOL: +0.6** — Strong network adoption and positive news about daily active users and memecoin activity highlight Solana's growth potential, justifying a higher allocation preference.

**DOGE: +0.2** — While lacking significant news, Dogecoin's recent price and momentum signals are positive, suggesting a slight increase in allocation is warranted.

**USDT: -0.3** — With positive signals in other cryptocurrencies and a general market sentiment leaning towards risk-taking, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-31 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which can be favorable for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing bullish momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's potential rally towards $100K and Ethereum's expected rebound to $4,000 suggest strong market confidence. Solana continues to demonstrate significant growth potential, with comparisons to major payment platforms like PayPal. Dogecoin and USDT remain stable, with no significant news impacting their outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive momentum and bullish news suggesting a potential rally to $100K make Bitcoin an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and optimistic news about a potential rebound to $4,000 support a positive allocation, though slightly less aggressive than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued growth and scalability comparisons to PayPal support a moderate increase in allocation, though current technicals are less compelling than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-31 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX and a steady U.S. Dollar Index. The crypto market shows signs of bullish momentum, particularly in BTC and ETH, supported by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in on-chain activity and has a potential upward trajectory toward $100K by year-end. Ethereum also shows bullish momentum with expectations of reaching $4,000. Solana continues to attract attention due to its scalability, though its technical indicators are mixed. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, with DOGE maintaining a steady upward trend in technicals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment suggesting a potential rally to $100K. Increased on-chain activity supports the positive outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum with expectations of a price rebound to $4,000. Strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment bolster confidence.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, Solana's growth potential and scalability attract attention. Positive sentiment around its potential as a payment solution adds to its appeal.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators. Maintains a steady trend without clear signals for strong allocation shifts.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and ETH, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-08-31 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential upward movement, supported by predictions of a possible surge toward $100K by year-end. Ethereum also has positive expectations, with analysts suggesting a return to the $4,000 level. Solana continues to gain attention due to its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems. Despite the bullish indicators, macroeconomic factors such as a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500 suggest a balanced risk environment, which may limit aggressive capital shifts. USDT remains stable, with no significant news or market disruptions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment regarding potential price surges support increased allocation, despite mixed short-term technical signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive news about potential price recovery to $4,000 suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Although technical signals are mixed, Solana's strong growth narrative and potential to rival payment giants support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The cryptocurrency market shows bullish momentum across major assets like BTC and ETH, supported by positive long-term predictions and technical indicators. Bitcoin is showing signs of strength with predictions of a potential surge toward $100K by year-end, while Ethereum is expected to rebound to $4,000. Solana continues to gain attention due to its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, although recent price movements have been mixed. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, but DOGE maintains a bullish technical stance. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a preference for growth-oriented assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment suggest potential for significant upside, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and optimistic price predictions support a favorable allocation, though slightly less aggressive than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued interest in Solana's scalability and potential as a payment solution justifies a positive allocation, despite mixed short-term price signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — While lacking significant news, DOGE's technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-31 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish technical indicators and positive news for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by predictions of a potential rally to $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards the $4,000 level, indicating a positive outlook. Solana continues to gain attention for its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, contributing to its bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, but technical indicators suggest a generally positive environment for cryptocurrencies, with stablecoin USDT showing potential breakout signals, indicating a possible shift in capital allocation preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with positive news predicting a significant price surge, make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical indicators and optimistic news about a potential price rebound to $4,000 support a favorable outlook, though slightly less compelling than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and positive sentiment regarding its scalability and growth potential justify a favorable allocation, though slightly tempered by less immediate price action compared to BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite positive technical signals, the lack of significant news or developments keeps DOGE in a neutral position, warranting a hold strategy.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market sentiment leaning bullish, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of higher-risk assets with greater upside potential."
2024-08-31 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is showing potential for a significant rally, potentially reaching $100K by year-end, supported by strong technical signals and positive news sentiment. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards the $4,000 level, reflecting a generally positive outlook. Solana continues to demonstrate robust growth and scalability, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms like PayPal. Meanwhile, DOGE and USDT lack significant news, with DOGE maintaining stable activity and USDT showing signs of a potential breakout, indicating a possible shift in risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news sentiment, suggesting potential for a significant upward move. Current holdings should be increased to capitalize on the expected rally.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical momentum and optimistic news sentiment regarding a potential rebound to $4,000. Increasing exposure is warranted given the favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued strong growth and scalability prospects, supported by positive technical signals. The asset remains attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite stable technical indicators, the lack of significant news and activity suggests a neutral stance. Maintain current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to take advantage of potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX at 15.18) and a stable U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 101.7). The crypto market is experiencing bullish momentum across major assets, supported by positive technical indicators and optimistic news forecasts. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing strong buy signals, with predictions of significant price increases by the end of the year. Solana continues to demonstrate robust growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, but technical indicators remain positive.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news sentiment, with predictions of a potential rally to $100K, suggest a favorable environment for increasing exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent skepticism, technical indicators and positive news about a potential rebound to $4,000 support a moderately strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent growth and scalability potential, as highlighted in the news, along with strong technical signals, justify a positive allocation score.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, the absence of significant news and relatively low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-08-31 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, suggesting a slightly weaker dollar, which can be supportive of crypto assets. Across the crypto market, technical indicators show a generally bullish sentiment with buy signals across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, supported by positive momentum signals. On-chain activity for BTC and ETH shows some fluctuations but remains within normal ranges. News highlights potential bullish scenarios for BTC and ETH, with predictions of significant price increases by year-end. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability, potentially positioning itself as a major player in the payments space. DOGE and USDT lack significant news, indicating a stable outlook for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news sentiment suggest potential for significant upside. The prediction of a rally toward $100K by year-end further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical signals and news suggesting a potential rebound to $4,000 support a positive allocation. Although on-chain activity is low, the overall sentiment remains optimistic.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite a recent price decrease, Solana's strong growth narrative and potential to rival traditional payment systems provide a compelling case for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment across other crypto assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by overall bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with technical indicators showing strong buy signals for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is particularly buoyed by predictions of a potential surge to $100K by year-end, while Ethereum is expected to rebound toward $4,000. Solana continues to attract attention due to its impressive growth and potential to rival traditional payment systems. Despite the positive momentum, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in traditional financial indicators, suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment regarding potential price surge to $100K. On-chain activity supports increased exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and news suggesting a rebound to $4,000. Moderate increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued strong growth and scalability potential, supported by positive technical signals. Worth increasing exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite technical buy signals, lack of significant news and mixed momentum indicators suggest holding current position.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more capital to risk assets is advisable."
2024-08-31 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of potential upward movement. Bitcoin is buoyed by predictions of a possible surge toward $100K by year-end, supported by strong on-chain activity and technical indicators. Ethereum also has a positive outlook with expectations of a rebound to $4,000. Solana continues to show strong growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms like PayPal. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, with Dogecoin showing mixed technical signals and USDT maintaining its stablecoin role. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable S&P 500 performance, suggests a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and bullish predictions support increased allocation, especially given the potential for a significant year-end rally.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and bullish news about a potential rebound to $4,000 make Ethereum attractive, though slightly less so than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's impressive growth and scalability potential position it well for further gains, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintaining current exposure to Dogecoin seems prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to USDT aligns with a shift toward riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's technical indicators show strong upward momentum, supported by predictions of a potential rally to $100K by year-end. Ethereum also shows bullish momentum, with analysts expecting a rebound to the $4,000 level. Solana's growth and scalability are drawing attention, potentially positioning it as a significant player in the payments space. However, Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news or strong technical signals, indicating a more neutral stance. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a slight shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news sentiment suggest potential for significant price appreciation. The prediction of a rally to $100K adds confidence to increasing exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news sentiment about a potential rebound to $4,000 support a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and news highlighting Solana's growth and potential as a payment platform suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to reallocate capital towards higher-growth assets."
2024-08-31 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is relatively low at 101.7, which may support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit strong technical indicators, with both showing buy signals and bullish momentum. News suggests potential for significant upside in BTC and ETH, with predictions of BTC reaching $100K and ETH returning to $4,000. Solana is highlighted for its scalability, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms, which may bolster its attractiveness. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, but DOGE shows consistent buy signals despite no bullish momentum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with positive news predicting a significant price surge, make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, along with optimistic news of a potential price rebound to $4,000, support increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and news highlighting its scalability and growth potential enhance its attractiveness, although recent price stability tempers the score slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite consistent buy signals, the lack of bullish momentum and significant news keeps DOGE neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.5 — With strong bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a cautiously optimistic sentiment, with positive technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in on-chain activity, and there is bullish momentum, supported by predictions of a potential rally to $100K by year-end. Ethereum also shows bullish momentum, with expectations of a rebound to $4,000. Solana is gaining attention due to its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, although its technical indicators are mixed. Dogecoin shows no significant news or momentum changes, while USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, coupled with positive news predicting a potential rally, make BTC an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent skepticism, bullish momentum and positive news about a potential rebound to $4,000 support a favorable outlook for ETH.

SOL: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, Solana's potential as a scalable payment system and its massive growth since 2020 provide a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no strong reason to adjust current exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capture potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability, with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and a stable U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The crypto market is showing signs of potential bullish momentum, particularly for BTC and ETH, supported by positive technical indicators and optimistic news forecasts. Bitcoin's potential to reach $100K by year-end and Ethereum's expected rebound to $4,000 are significant bullish signals. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, although its technical indicators are currently mixed. DOGE lacks significant news, and USDT remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news sentiment about a potential rally to $100K. On-chain activity is also robust, supporting a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Positive technical indicators and news suggesting a potential rebound to $4,000 make ETH attractive. Despite recent skepticism, the overall sentiment is turning bullish.

SOL: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, the news about Solana's scalability and potential to rival payment giants like PayPal provides a long-term bullish outlook. However, caution is warranted due to current technical signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest a neutral stance. No strong signals to increase or decrease exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes in market conditions or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent. It serves as a stable anchor amidst potential market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context indicates a stable environment with moderate volatility, as reflected by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is relatively low at 101.7, which could support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing strong technical signals with bullish momentum and positive news sentiment, suggesting potential upward movement. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability, although it lacks a strong technical buy signal. Dogecoin and USDT have no significant news, and their technical indicators are mixed. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for gains in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment about a potential rally to $100K support increasing allocation to Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical signals and optimistic news about a potential rebound to $4,000 justify a positive allocation score.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite lacking a strong buy signal, Solana's scalability and growth potential offer a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins aligns with increased risk appetite."
2024-08-31 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The S&P 500 is relatively high, suggesting a risk-on sentiment, which could support crypto investments. Bitcoin shows strong potential with a bullish trend and positive news predicting a surge to $100K, while Ethereum is also expected to rebound to $4,000. Solana's growth narrative positions it as a potential disruptor in the payments space, though its technical indicators are mixed. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and its technicals show no clear bullish momentum. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news predicting a significant price increase make BTC highly attractive. Its on-chain activity also supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, the bullish trend and positive news about a potential rebound to $4,000 suggest a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana's technical indicators are mixed, its long-term growth potential and comparison to major payment systems provide a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, there is no strong reason to adjust the current position in Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which could be supportive of risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum both have bullish news narratives suggesting potential significant price increases by year-end, which may influence investor sentiment positively. Solana's narrative around its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems adds a layer of long-term growth potential. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and USDT have no significant news, indicating a neutral stance. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with potential for upward movement, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news sentiment about a potential surge to $100K, combined with recent bullish technical indicators, supports a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent technical weakness, the positive news outlook of reaching $4K and consistent on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.3 — While technical indicators are not currently bullish, the strong growth narrative and potential for scalability provide a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust holdings.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the optimistic outlook for BTC and ETH, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of riskier assets aligns with the current market sentiment."
2024-08-31 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and the S&P 500 maintaining a high level. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end, supported by positive technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. Ethereum, despite recent price declines, has a bullish outlook with expectations of reaching $4,000. Solana's scalability and growth potential are being compared to major payment systems, suggesting a strong long-term outlook. Dogecoin and USDT have no significant news, with DOGE showing mixed technical signals and USDT maintaining stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin's potential for a significant rally towards $100K and strong on-chain activity suggest a favorable outlook. The macroeconomic context supports risk-on sentiment, making BTC an attractive asset.

ETH: +0.5 — Although Ethereum is currently below its lower Bollinger Band, the positive news about a potential rebound to $4,000 and continued strong on-chain activity provide a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's potential to rival major payment systems and its massive growth since 2020 support a positive long-term view, despite current technical signals being neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. The lack of a clear catalyst suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with a moderate 10-Year Treasury Yield and a low VIX indicating low market volatility. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which could support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is showing signs of potential long-term strength, with analysts predicting a possible surge to $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards $4,000, despite recent price declines. Solana continues to be highlighted for its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems. However, short-term technical indicators for most assets remain bearish, with many showing no buy signals and momentum indicators below their signal lines. USDT remains stable, with bullish momentum suggesting a potential breakout.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite short-term technical indicators being neutral, the strong long-term prediction and potential for a significant rally towards $100K provide a compelling case for increased exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical signals are currently bearish, the news of a potential rebound to $4,000 suggests a positive long-term outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's impressive growth and potential to rival payment systems like PayPal support a slightly increased allocation, although short-term technicals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the lack of clear directional signals.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for bullish moves in other cryptocurrencies and the stablecoin's current bullish momentum, reducing exposure to USDT slightly in favor of riskier assets could be beneficial."
2024-08-31 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which could support crypto assets as they often move inversely to the dollar. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing potential for significant upside based on news predictions, with Bitcoin possibly reaching $100K and Ethereum aiming for a $4K level. Solana continues to gain attention for its scalability, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. Despite this, technical indicators across BTC, ETH, and SOL show no immediate buy signals, suggesting a cautious approach. DOGE shows some positive technical signals but lacks news support, while USDT remains stable with bullish momentum, indicating a preference for risk-off sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news sentiment with potential for a significant rally by year-end. However, technical indicators are currently neutral, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — News suggests potential rebound to $4K, but technical indicators remain neutral. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite strong growth and positive news comparisons, technical indicators are neutral. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some technical buy signals, the lack of significant news and mixed momentum suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish sentiment in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT is advisable to reallocate capital towards these assets."
2024-08-31 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing potential for significant price appreciation by year-end, according to recent predictions. However, current technical indicators for both assets do not yet signal a strong buy. Solana's impressive growth and scalability continue to attract attention, though it lacks immediate bullish signals in the short term. Dogecoin and USDT have no significant news, with DOGE showing mixed technical signals and USDT maintaining its role as a stablecoin in a neutral market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical indicators, the potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end suggests a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are not currently bullish, the potential for a rebound to $4,000 supports a slightly positive allocation.

SOL: +0.1 — Solana's long-term growth potential and scalability are positive, but current technical indicators do not support a strong buy.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and lack of significant news result in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish trends in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on risk assets."
2024-08-31 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end, as suggested by analysts. Ethereum also has a positive outlook, with expectations of a rebound to $4,000, despite recent skepticism. Solana's impressive growth and scalability are drawing comparisons to major payment platforms, indicating strong long-term potential. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, suggesting a stable but unremarkable position in the current market environment. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk, favoring assets with strong growth potential.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the bullish news sentiment and potential for a significant year-end rally make Bitcoin an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive news sentiment about a potential rebound to $4,000, combined with a stable macroeconomic environment, supports a moderate increase in Ethereum allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Although technical indicators do not show immediate bullish signals, Solana's strong growth narrative and potential to rival major payment platforms justify a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current exposure to Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment and potential for growth in other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on the risk-on environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with potential bullish outlooks for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin is showing resilience with predictions of a significant rally towards $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound to $4,000, suggesting a positive sentiment in the market. Solana continues to gain attention due to its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, indicating a more stable or neutral position. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no drastic changes in major indices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite no immediate technical buy signals, the bullish news sentiment and potential for a year-end rally support a positive outlook. On-chain activity is also robust, indicating strong network engagement.

ETH: +0.5 — While technical indicators are neutral, the positive news sentiment about a potential rebound to $4,000 suggests a favorable outlook. The asset remains attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Although technical indicators are not currently bullish, the strong growth narrative and potential to rival major payment systems make Solana an appealing asset for incremental capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust exposure at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment and potential upward movement in other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-09-01 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, which is relatively neutral, and gold prices are high, indicating some risk aversion in traditional markets. Over the past four hours, the cryptocurrency market has shown limited movement with no significant price changes or news influencing BTC, ETH, SOL, or DOGE. Technical indicators across these assets are mostly neutral, with no strong buy or sell signals. USDT shows a consistent buy signal, suggesting a preference for stability, but given the absence of significant market shifts, this may reflect a cautious stance rather than a strong directional move.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — BTC shows mixed signals with no significant momentum or trend direction. The lack of news and stable macroeconomic indicators suggest holding the current position.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH lacks strong directional signals both in technical indicators and news. The market environment suggests maintaining the current allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — SOL's technical indicators are neutral, and there is no significant news to drive a change in allocation. Holding the current position is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight buy signal in trend, the overall lack of momentum and news suggests maintaining the current allocation without changes.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the stable macroeconomic environment and neutral signals across other assets, a slight preference for USDT is warranted to maintain liquidity and flexibility in the portfolio."
2024-09-01 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a lack of significant news across major cryptocurrencies, with most assets experiencing minor price fluctuations and no clear directional trends. Bitcoin shows some bullish momentum in its MACD indicator, but overall, the market sentiment remains neutral to slightly bearish, as indicated by the lack of buy signals and the breakdown of several assets below their Bollinger Bands. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets. In this environment, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a slight preference for stability and liquidity is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the lack of a buy signal, BTC's bullish MACD momentum suggests a slight preference for holding, although overall market conditions are not strongly supportive.

ETH: -0.3 — ETH is showing signs of a potential breakdown with its price below the lower Bollinger Band and no bullish momentum, suggesting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.4 — SOL's significant price decrease and breakdown below the Bollinger Band indicate potential further downside, warranting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — DOGE's price is also below the lower Bollinger Band, with no bullish signals, suggesting a cautious approach despite a current holding.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current market environment, with several assets showing potential breakdowns, maintaining liquidity in USDT is advisable to manage risk and provide flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-09-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 15.37) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. However, the crypto market data over the past four hours indicates a bearish trend across most major cryptocurrencies, with BTC, ETH, and SOL all experiencing slight price declines and bearish technical indicators. DOGE shows some mixed signals with a buy trend signal but lacks momentum support. USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during uncertain times. The absence of significant news across all assets suggests that market movements are primarily driven by technical and macroeconomic factors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is showing bearish technical indicators with prices below the lower Bollinger Band and no significant bullish momentum. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

ETH: -0.4 — ETH is experiencing a downward trend with prices below the lower Bollinger Band and low on-chain activity. A reduction in exposure is recommended to mitigate further downside risk.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL has shown a significant price decrease and remains below its lower Bollinger Band. Although there's a slight recovery, the overall bearish sentiment suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a buy signal from the trend indicator, DOGE lacks momentum and has mixed signals. Maintaining current exposure is prudent until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: +0.5 — With the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and capital preservation strategy amidst market uncertainty."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight declines or sideways movement over the past four hours. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with prices hovering near or below key support levels, as indicated by Bollinger Bands. DOGE shows mixed signals, with a buy trend signal but no supporting momentum. USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market uncertainty. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a neutral to slightly bearish environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is showing weak momentum and technical signals, with no significant news to drive positive sentiment. Given the current portfolio holding, a slight reduction is prudent.

ETH: -0.2 — ETH is also experiencing weak technical indicators and low on-chain activity. With no news to support a bullish stance, a slight reduction is recommended.

SOL: 0.0 — SOL's price is stabilizing after a recent decline, with normal on-chain activity. Maintaining the current position is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a buy trend signal, DOGE lacks momentum and significant news. Holding the current position is appropriate given the mixed signals.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the cautious market sentiment and weak performance of other assets, increasing exposure to USDT is a prudent strategy to preserve capital and reduce risk."
2024-09-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies indicates a bearish trend, with all major assets showing a downward price movement and technical indicators pointing to a lack of bullish momentum. The absence of significant news across the board suggests that market participants are primarily driven by technicals and macroeconomic factors. Given the current conditions, there is a cautious sentiment in the market, with a preference for stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is experiencing a consistent downward trend with no bullish signals from technical indicators or on-chain activity. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted to manage risk.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum is also showing bearish technicals and low on-chain activity. While not as pronounced as Bitcoin, a modest reduction in exposure is advisable.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana has experienced significant price decreases and is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Given the large current holding, a more substantial reduction is prudent.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin is showing a breakdown in price with low activity. A slight reduction in exposure is recommended to align with the overall bearish sentiment.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish conditions across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and helps preserve capital during this period of uncertainty."
2024-09-01 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a bearish sentiment, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing a downward trend in prices over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD are not providing any bullish signals, and several assets are trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. The macroeconomic context shows moderate interest rates and a stable U.S. dollar index, while the S&P 500 is relatively high with low volatility, suggesting a neutral to slightly risk-averse broader market sentiment. In the absence of significant news, the market seems to be driven by technical and on-chain data, with no clear catalysts for a reversal in the current trend.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is experiencing a consistent price decline with no bullish technical signals. The lack of significant news and the breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band suggest reducing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also showing a downward price trend and is below its lower Bollinger Band. With no positive news or technical signals, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has seen a significant price decrease and is trading below its lower Bollinger Band. Despite normal on-chain activity, the lack of bullish indicators suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin is experiencing a significant price decrease and is below its lower Bollinger Band, with no supportive news or technical signals. Reducing exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. The stablecoin's stability makes it an attractive option during periods of market uncertainty."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The crypto market is experiencing a period of consolidation, with most assets showing no significant price changes over the past four hours. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of bullish momentum, as short-term moving averages remain below long-term averages and MACD signals are not supportive of upward trends. On-chain activity is mixed, with BTC showing a surge in transactions but generally low activity across other assets. The absence of significant news for any of the cryptocurrencies suggests that market sentiment is driven primarily by technical and macroeconomic factors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a surge in transaction activity, BTC is trading below its Bollinger Bands, indicating potential downside risk. Given the lack of bullish technical signals and the current portfolio holding, a slight reduction is warranted.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH shows no significant technical or on-chain activity changes, and with no news to influence sentiment, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

SOL: +0.1 — SOL has experienced a slight increase in price and normal on-chain activity, suggesting some stability. However, without strong bullish signals, only a modest positive allocation is justified.

DOGE: -0.2 — DOGE is trading below its Bollinger Bands with no supportive technical signals. Although there is an activity surge, the overall sentiment remains weak, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets and given the stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a defensive position to capitalize on future opportunities."
2024-09-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously bearish, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight to moderate declines over the past few hours. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of bullish momentum, as evidenced by short-term moving averages being below long-term ones and MACD signals remaining below their respective signal lines. Despite some recent price increases, these movements have not been strong enough to suggest a reversal of the current downtrend. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a neutral to slightly risk-off environment, which may favor holding stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a slight price recovery, technical indicators remain bearish, and there is no significant news to drive a strong buy signal. Maintain current exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical or news-driven signals to justify a change in allocation. Hold position.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued price weakness and lack of bullish signals suggest a cautious approach. Reduce exposure slightly, but maintain a core position given existing holdings.

DOGE: -0.1 — Although there was a slight increase in price, the overall sentiment remains weak with no significant news. Slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-09-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a lack of significant news across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets experiencing slight fluctuations in price and volume. Technical indicators suggest a generally bearish sentiment, as all observed assets show their short-term moving averages below their long-term ones, and MACD signals remain below the signal line, indicating a lack of bullish momentum. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a relatively strong U.S. Dollar Index, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. With no significant news to drive sentiment, the market appears to be in a consolidation phase, with a cautious outlook prevailing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a slight increase in on-chain activity, the technical indicators remain bearish, and there is no significant news to drive a strong directional move.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no clear bullish signals in technical indicators, and the absence of news leaves the market directionless.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL has experienced a significant price decrease and remains below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential further downside. Given current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a surge in on-chain activity, DOGE's technical indicators do not support a strong directional move, and the lack of news leaves sentiment unchanged.

USDT: +0.3 — In the current environment of bearish technical indicators across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safer position to mitigate risk."
2024-09-01 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which can be supportive for cryptocurrencies, but there is no significant bullish momentum in the crypto market. Across the board, technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD are not signaling strong buy opportunities for BTC, ETH, SOL, or DOGE. On-chain activity is mixed, with some surges in transactions for DOGE, but overall, there is no significant news or developments to drive strong directional moves. The market appears to be in a consolidation phase, with no clear bullish or bearish sentiment prevailing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a slight increase in price and a surge in on-chain activity, there is no strong technical or momentum signal to justify a change in allocation. The market appears to be consolidating.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum shows normal on-chain activity and price movement within the Bollinger Bands. Without significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's price is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential weakness. However, without significant news or strong bearish signals, only a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

DOGE: -0.1 — Although there is an increase in transaction activity, DOGE remains within the Bollinger Bands with no strong technical signals. A slight reduction in exposure is suggested due to the lack of bullish momentum.

USDT: +0.3 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment appears to be slightly bearish, with all major cryptocurrencies showing a downward trend over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD signals do not suggest any strong buy signals for BTC, ETH, SOL, or DOGE. The macroeconomic indicators, including a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggest a cautious market sentiment. There is no significant news impacting any of the assets, which further indicates a lack of strong directional catalysts. Given the absence of bullish signals and the overall market environment, maintaining a cautious approach with a preference for liquidity seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is experiencing slight price declines and lacks bullish technical indicators. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction is warranted to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong buy signals and has experienced a slight decrease in price. A small reduction aligns with the overall cautious sentiment.

SOL: -0.1 — SOL's price is slightly decreasing with no positive technical indicators. Maintaining a slightly reduced exposure is advisable.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE shows no significant changes in data or sentiment. Holding the current position is appropriate given the neutral outlook.

USDT: +0.6 — With the bearish sentiment across other assets and no strong buy signals, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and preserves capital in uncertain conditions."
2024-09-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low VIX, indicating reduced market volatility. However, the lack of significant bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies suggests a cautious market sentiment. The recent data shows slight price decreases across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, with no significant news to drive market sentiment. On-chain activity remains mostly normal, with no major disruptions or surges that could indicate a shift in market dynamics. In this environment, a conservative approach with a focus on maintaining liquidity and stability is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — The technical indicators show no clear bullish signals, and on-chain activity is stable but not indicative of a strong market move. Maintaining current exposure is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no significant technical or on-chain signals to warrant a change in allocation. Holding the current position is recommended.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a lack of strong technical signals, SOL's recent price increase and stable on-chain activity suggest a slight positive sentiment. A modest increase in allocation is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE shows increased on-chain activity, but without significant price movement or news, maintaining the current allocation is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment and lack of strong bullish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2024-09-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a lack of significant bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets exhibiting neutral to slightly bearish technical indicators. The macroeconomic context presents a relatively stable backdrop, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates. The absence of significant news for any of the assets suggests a lack of catalysts to drive strong directional moves. In this context, the market sentiment appears cautious, with no clear trends emerging. The stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven, reflecting the market's cautious stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin's technical indicators are neutral, with no significant news to drive momentum. The market appears to be in a holding pattern.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum shows no strong technical signals or news catalysts, suggesting a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of news, Solana's recent price increase and consistent on-chain activity suggest a slight preference for allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's activity surge is not accompanied by positive price action or news, warranting a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential volatility."
2024-09-01 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a lack of significant news and relatively stable macroeconomic indicators. The U.S. Dollar Index remains steady, and volatility as measured by the VIX is low, suggesting a stable broader market environment. Across the cryptocurrencies, there is a general absence of strong buy signals, with all assets showing short-term moving averages below their longer-term counterparts and MACD indicators below signal lines, indicating a lack of bullish momentum. On-chain activity is mostly normal, with some surges in transaction activity for BTC and DOGE, but without corresponding price movements or news to suggest a strong directional bias.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — While there is some increased on-chain activity, the technical indicators do not support a bullish stance. The absence of significant news also suggests a neutral position.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical or news-based signals to warrant a change in allocation. The market remains neutral with normal on-chain activity.

SOL: +0.1 — Although there is no strong technical or news-based signal, SOL's recent volume increase and slight price uptick suggest a marginally positive outlook compared to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite increased transaction activity, there is no significant price movement or news to suggest a change in allocation. The market remains neutral.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the lack of bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a defensive position is prudent in the current stable market environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. dollar index is slightly lower, which can be supportive for cryptocurrencies as they often benefit from a weaker dollar. However, the market data for the past four hours shows a lack of strong bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets trading within normal ranges and no significant news to drive momentum. On-chain activity is mixed, with some assets like DOGE showing increased transaction activity, but this has not translated into strong price movements. Overall, the market sentiment appears neutral to slightly bearish, with no clear catalysts for a significant upward move.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin is showing no strong technical or on-chain signals to suggest a directional move. The absence of significant news further supports a neutral stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum lacks strong technical indicators or news to drive a significant allocation change. On-chain activity is normal, supporting a hold position.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of a buy signal, Solana's consistent transaction activity and slight price increases suggest a modest preference for allocation, albeit with caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased transaction activity is noted, but it hasn't translated into price strength. With no significant news, a neutral position is justified.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals in other assets and the stable macro environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-09-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with slight fluctuations in prices across major cryptocurrencies. Despite some minor price increases in the last hour, the overall technical indicators, such as moving averages and MACD, do not signal a strong bullish trend for BTC, ETH, or DOGE. SOL shows some positive momentum with a significant price increase and bullish momentum signal, suggesting potential short-term strength. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, does not indicate significant external pressures on the crypto market. With no significant news affecting the assets today, the market appears to be in a holding pattern, with no clear directional bias.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite some fluctuations in price, BTC lacks strong technical signals or news to suggest a significant move in either direction. Maintaining a neutral stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical or fundamental signals to warrant a change in allocation. Holding current position.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest potential short-term strength. Increasing allocation slightly to capitalize on this momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite slight price increases, DOGE lacks strong technical signals or news to justify a change in allocation. Maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the overall lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-09-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, technical indicators show no strong buy signals, and on-chain activity is mixed. Maintain current exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical or on-chain signals to justify a change in allocation. Hold current position.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum indicated by MACD, along with stable on-chain activity, suggests a potential for upward movement. Slightly increase exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in technical indicators or on-chain activity. Maintain current allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals in other assets, maintain current USDT holdings to manage risk and liquidity."
2024-09-01 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility indicated by the VIX and a steady U.S. dollar index. The cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals, with no significant news driving sentiment for any of the assets. BTC and ETH have shown slight fluctuations in price with no strong technical buy signals, while SOL has demonstrated some bullish momentum despite a lack of news. DOGE remains relatively stable with no significant market activity or news, and USDT continues to serve as a stable anchor in the portfolio. Overall, the market sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive, with some assets showing potential for modest gains.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the lack of strong buy signals, BTC's recent on-chain activity surge and stable price suggest a slight preference for maintaining exposure.

ETH: +0.1 — ETH shows some bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's bullish momentum and recent price increase make it relatively attractive compared to other assets, suggesting a stronger buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in data or sentiment, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the slight positive sentiment in the market, a modest reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with slight upward movements in prices for major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past hour. Despite the lack of significant news, the technical indicators suggest some bullish momentum, particularly for SOL, which has shown consistent bullish momentum across the last four hours. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with no drastic changes in major indicators like the U.S. Dollar Index or the S&P 500, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk environment. However, the lack of strong buy signals across most assets indicates a cautious approach is warranted, with a potential preference for maintaining liquidity in USDT to manage risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While BTC shows some bullish momentum, the overall technical indicators remain mixed. The slight increase in price and normal on-chain activity suggest a cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.2 — ETH has shown a slight increase in price and bullish momentum, but the lack of significant news and mixed technical signals warrant a conservative approach.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL demonstrates strong bullish momentum and significant price increases, making it relatively more attractive for capital allocation compared to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, DOGE's technical indicators remain largely neutral, with no significant news to drive a strong allocation decision.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the slight bullish sentiment in the market, a modest reduction in USDT holdings may be warranted to take advantage of potential gains in other assets."
2024-09-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with slight upward movements in several cryptocurrencies, particularly SOL and DOGE, over the past few hours. Despite the lack of significant news, the technical indicators show some bullish momentum, especially for SOL, which has a buy signal on its trend and momentum indicators. BTC and ETH are showing mixed signals with some bullish momentum but no significant trend changes. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets. However, the lack of significant news and the general sideways movement in prices indicate a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite no significant news, BTC shows some bullish momentum, and its price has been relatively stable. The overall market environment supports a modest increase in exposure.

ETH: +0.2 — ETH has shown slight price increases and bullish momentum, suggesting a cautious increase in allocation, though no significant news or trend changes were noted.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL shows strong bullish momentum and a buy signal, supported by increased volume and positive price movement. This warrants a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE has experienced slight price increases but lacks strong momentum or trend signals. Maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the slight bullish sentiment in other assets, a modest reduction in USDT is appropriate to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2024-09-01 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic indicators suggest a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, which is neither too strong nor too weak, suggesting a balanced risk environment. Across the crypto market, BTC and ETH show bullish momentum with MACD signals above their respective signal lines, but lack strong trend signals. SOL is showing a buy signal with both short-term moving averages and MACD indicating bullish momentum, while DOGE remains relatively stagnant with no significant trend signals. USDT is maintaining its stability as expected for a stablecoin, but with a buy signal in its trend indicator, suggesting a potential increase in demand for stability amidst uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a strong trend signal, BTC's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a moderate preference for allocation, especially given the absence of significant news.

ETH: +0.4 — ETH mirrors BTC with bullish momentum, and the slight increase in price and activity suggests a positive outlook, though slightly less pronounced than BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL shows the strongest buy signal with both trend and momentum indicators pointing upwards, coupled with significant volume, making it relatively more attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE lacks strong momentum or trend signals, and with no significant news, it remains a hold without clear directional preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Although USDT shows a buy signal in its trend indicator, the overall market conditions and bullish signals in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. The cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals, with most assets experiencing slight price fluctuations and maintaining normal on-chain activity. Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit bullish momentum, but lack strong trend signals, indicating potential but not definitive upward movement. Solana stands out with consistent buy signals across trend and momentum indicators, suggesting a more favorable outlook. Dogecoin, despite some bullish momentum, lacks clear trend signals, while USDT remains stable with no significant changes in market conditions or news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bullish momentum, the absence of a strong trend signal suggests a cautious approach. Maintain moderate exposure as it fits well with a balanced portfolio strategy.

ETH: +0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows bullish momentum but lacks a strong trend signal. A slight increase in allocation is justified given its market position and activity.

SOL: +0.6 — Consistent buy signals in both trend and momentum indicators, along with significant volume, make SOL the most attractive asset currently. Increase exposure to capitalize on potential upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some bullish momentum, the lack of a clear trend signal and significant news keeps DOGE in a neutral position. Hold current exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive signals in other assets, reduce USDT exposure to reallocate capital towards higher potential returns in BTC, ETH, and SOL."
2024-09-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be bearish, with significant price decreases observed across major cryptocurrencies in the last hour. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced notable declines, breaking below their respective lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Despite the bearish price action, Solana maintains a bullish trend signal with its short MA above the long MA, suggesting some underlying strength. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with a buy signal on its trend indicator, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of increased market volatility. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests that the broader financial environment is not exerting additional pressure on the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Significant price decrease and breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band indicate bearish sentiment. Reduce exposure to mitigate potential losses.

ETH: -0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH has experienced a significant price drop and breakdown, with no supporting news or bullish signals to counteract the bearish trend.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop, SOL maintains a bullish trend signal, suggesting potential resilience. However, caution is warranted given the broader market conditions.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant price decrease and breakdown, coupled with no bullish signals, suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT provides a stable hedge against volatility and potential further declines in other assets."
2024-09-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with signs of potential bearish pressure. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant price declines in recent hours, breaking below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Solana, despite having a buy signal from its short-term moving average, also shows signs of weakness with a recent price decline. Dogecoin is similarly under pressure, with its price below the lower Bollinger Band. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a lack of strong external drivers for a bullish crypto market. In this environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT could be prudent to manage risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent significant price drop and breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band suggest caution. No significant news to support a bullish stance.

ETH: -0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH has experienced a significant price decline and is below its lower Bollinger Band. The lack of supportive news and bearish technicals warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a buy signal from the short-term moving average, the recent price decline and breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — The price is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential bearish pressure. However, the recent slight price increase suggests some resilience.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish signals across other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-09-02 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced significant outflows from U.S. ETFs, indicating a lack of institutional confidence, although upcoming U.S. macroeconomic data could provide some support. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact its use in financial settlements. Dogecoin has been one of the top decliners, reflecting broader market sentiment. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option, with its price holding steady and showing bullish momentum signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support and bullish momentum signals suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts creates a slightly negative outlook, despite some recovery in price.

SOL: +0.2 — Although there is no significant news, the asset maintains a buy signal on trend, suggesting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a stable hedge."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing seasonal bearishness, compounded by ETF outflows, though potential macroeconomic developments might offer some support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainties due to potential SEC actions, which could impact its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings. Solana shows some technical strength despite a lack of significant news, while Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting broader market bearishness. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst uncertain conditions. Overall, the market is cautious, with potential for volatility driven by macroeconomic data releases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support could stabilize BTC. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding Ethereum's use in FTX's bankruptcy add uncertainty. Reduce exposure slightly.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical indicators show some bullish signals, and despite the lack of news, SOL's resilience suggests potential for gains. Increase exposure moderately.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment suggest a cautious approach. Reduce exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a stablecoin buffer is prudent. Increase exposure slightly."
2024-09-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing a seasonally bearish start to September, with ETF outflows indicating reduced institutional interest. However, potential macroeconomic developments, such as U.S. manufacturing and jobs data, could provide a tailwind if they lead to a weaker dollar. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's potential intervention in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which could affect its market dynamics. Solana and Tether have no significant news, while Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility, suggest a mixed environment with no strong directional bias.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the bearish seasonal trend and ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support from a weaker dollar could provide upward pressure. Maintain a cautious positive stance.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC's potential actions against FTX creditor payouts in ETH creates a cautious outlook. Technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.2 — No significant news, but the asset maintains stable on-chain activity and technicals. A slight positive allocation is warranted given the lack of negative catalysts.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent bearish sentiment and price declines suggest reducing exposure. The asset is underperforming compared to others, warranting caution.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-09-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a slight upward movement in Bitcoin, despite a bearish start to September. The potential for supportive macroeconomic data, such as weaker U.S. dollar signals, could bolster Bitcoin's price. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty with the SEC potentially challenging its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan, which may weigh on its performance. Dogecoin has been among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment, while Solana and USDT have no significant news impacting their outlook. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable S&P 500 and a low VIX, suggest a relatively calm market environment, which might support a moderate risk-on approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows slight upward momentum and potential macroeconomic support. Despite ETF outflows, the possibility of a weaker dollar could provide a tailwind.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory concerns with the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts in Ethereum create uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite no significant news, Solana's consistent on-chain activity and slight price increases suggest a stable outlook.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given current holdings.

USDT: +0.1 — While stablecoins typically see reduced allocation in risk-on environments, maintaining a slight positive allocation is prudent given potential market volatility."
2024-09-02 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt as we enter September. Bitcoin is experiencing seasonal bearishness, with ETF outflows indicating reduced institutional interest. However, potential macroeconomic developments, such as U.S. manufacturing and jobs data, could weaken the dollar and provide some support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges with the SEC possibly blocking its use in FTX creditor payouts, adding uncertainty. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting broader market bearishness. Solana and USDT have no significant news, but USDT's technicals suggest a possible breakdown, indicating a potential shift in capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite seasonal bearishness and ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support and increased on-chain activity provide a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.2 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC and sideways technical indicators suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a change in allocation; maintain current exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant recent price decrease and bearish sentiment warrant a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — With market uncertainty and potential breakdown signals, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic despite some bearish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight uptick, and upcoming U.S. economic data could potentially weaken the dollar, which may provide support for BTC. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings. Solana has no significant news but shows a recent price increase. Dogecoin has been among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no major news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for upward movement with upcoming macroeconomic data possibly weakening the dollar, providing a supportive environment despite recent ETF outflows.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX's use of Ethereum create uncertainty, balancing out any potential bullish sentiment from market movements.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite no significant news, Solana's recent price increase and stable on-chain activity suggest a moderate opportunity for capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent declines and bearish sentiment make Dogecoin less attractive, but given the small holding, a slight reduction is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish opportunities in other assets, reducing exposure to USDT could allow for better capital allocation in a cautiously optimistic market environment."
2024-09-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent ETF outflows and potential macroeconomic support from weakening U.S. dollar prospects. Ethereum faces potential regulatory hurdles from the SEC, which could impact its use in specific financial processes, adding a layer of uncertainty. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but Dogecoin has been identified as a laggard in the market, experiencing a notable decline. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable 10-Year Treasury Yield and low volatility index, suggest a relatively stable environment, but the bearish start to September could influence short-term market behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of strong technical buy signals, Bitcoin's resilience and potential macroeconomic tailwinds provide a moderately positive outlook. The ETF outflows are a concern but not overly detrimental at this stage.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding Ethereum's use in FTX creditor payouts creates a cautious stance. Technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Solana remains a relatively attractive option for capital allocation, especially given its recent price stability.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's recent decline and lack of positive momentum suggest reducing exposure. The absence of supportive news further justifies this cautious stance.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining some exposure to USDT as a hedge against market downturns is prudent."
2024-09-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price decreases across most major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown some resilience with potential support from macroeconomic developments that could weaken the U.S. dollar, but it remains under pressure with ETF outflows. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC challenges, which could weigh on its price. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced notable price declines, with Dogecoin particularly affected by bearish sentiment. In this environment, USDT remains stable, reflecting a possible flight to safety amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price fluctuations and ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support and bullish on-chain activity suggest a modest positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC and lack of bullish technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction.

SOL: -0.1 — Significant recent price decrease and lack of supportive news or technical signals warrant a cautious approach, maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Continued price decline and bearish sentiment make it prudent to reduce exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market uncertainty and bearish sentiment in other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-09-02 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential support from upcoming macroeconomic data that could weaken the U.S. dollar. Despite a slight uptick in Bitcoin's price, the broader market remains wary due to recent ETF outflows. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty with potential SEC challenges, which could weigh on its price. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced significant price increases in the past hour, although Dogecoin's recent decline highlights its volatility. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly bullish environment, favoring risk assets over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Bitcoin's potential support from macroeconomic data and bullish momentum signals suggest a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts introduce uncertainty, balancing out the recent price increase and bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — Significant price increase and consistent on-chain activity indicate a positive short-term outlook, although lacking major news catalysts.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price volatility and low on-chain activity suggest caution, but no strong sell signal given the current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent declines. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum driven by potential macroeconomic tailwinds, despite ETF outflows. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which may weigh on sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have seen price increases, though Dogecoin's recent decline highlights its volatility. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets. However, the U.S. dollar's potential weakening could further support cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, with potential macroeconomic support from a weakening dollar.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX's bankruptcy plan create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana has demonstrated significant price increases and positive momentum, though lacking specific news catalysts.

DOGE: -0.1 — While Dogecoin has seen a recent price uptick, its previous decline and low transaction activity suggest caution, especially given its volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment shifts towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin holdings aligns with a strategy to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-09-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a slight bullish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin's price is showing upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the dollar, providing further support. Ethereum is experiencing positive price action, though it faces regulatory uncertainties due to potential SEC actions. Solana and Dogecoin are also experiencing price increases, but without significant news to drive sentiment. The broader market is seeing some volatility, as indicated by the VIX, but the S&P 500 remains stable, suggesting a mixed macroeconomic environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic tailwinds. Despite ETF outflows, the overall sentiment remains positive with increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is experiencing bullish momentum and price increases, although regulatory concerns pose a risk. The technicals are supportive, justifying a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana is showing price increases and bullish momentum, though lacking significant news. The technical indicators suggest a cautious positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, Dogecoin's sentiment remains mixed with no significant news to drive a strong allocation change.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of bullish momentum, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-09-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing bullish momentum and buy signals in technical indicators. Bitcoin's price is stable around $58,500, with potential macroeconomic support from anticipated U.S. data that could weaken the dollar. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty with the SEC potentially blocking its use in FTX creditor payouts, which could dampen sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have shown recent price increases, but Dogecoin's recent decline suggests mixed sentiment. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid these dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite regulatory concerns, Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, suggesting a cautious buy signal.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's price increase and bullish momentum signal a moderate buy, though lacking significant news support.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price decline and bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure, though current holdings are minimal.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-09-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent ETF outflows and a generally bearish start to September. The anticipation of U.S. economic data potentially weakening the dollar could provide further support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts, which could weigh on its sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin facing bearish sentiment as one of the top decliners. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support from a weaker dollar suggest a favorable outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX payouts create uncertainty, balancing out its bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive momentum and normal on-chain activity, although lacking significant news, suggests a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment make it less attractive, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable market conditions, maintaining a neutral position in Tether is prudent as a hedge against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience amid a seasonally bearish period. Despite ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic developments could provide support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which could weigh on sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin show mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin experiencing a decline amid bearish sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a balanced risk environment, though the U.S. dollar's potential weakening could favor crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain strong, and potential macroeconomic support could drive upward momentum.

ETH: -0.3 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding Ethereum in FTX's bankruptcy plan create uncertainty, overshadowing its bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.2 — While lacking significant news, Solana's technical indicators are positive, suggesting potential for modest gains.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment warrant caution, though technicals remain somewhat supportive.

USDT: 0.0 — With a balanced risk environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT allows for flexibility in capital allocation as market conditions evolve."
2024-09-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of resilience despite recent ETF outflows and a seasonally bearish start to September. The potential for supportive macroeconomic data could further bolster Bitcoin's position. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainties with the SEC potentially challenging its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which may weigh on its sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive price movements, with Solana experiencing a significant price increase, although Dogecoin's recent decline positions it as a laggard. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's upward momentum and potential macroeconomic support make it attractive, despite ETF outflows. The market sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainties with the SEC and mixed price movements suggest a neutral stance, awaiting clearer signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong price increase and positive momentum indicate a favorable outlook, despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price increase is overshadowed by its status as a top decliner, suggesting caution in increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — With a cautiously optimistic market, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to allocate more capital to growth assets."
2024-09-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent ETF outflows and a seasonally bearish start to September. Anticipated macroeconomic data could potentially weaken the U.S. dollar, providing further support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions against its use in FTX creditor payouts, which may weigh on sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have shown mixed signals, with Solana experiencing positive technical indicators and Dogecoin lagging behind in performance. The stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven, but current market conditions suggest a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and potential macroeconomic developments could support further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX payouts creates a neutral outlook despite positive technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical signals and a significant price increase suggest a favorable outlook, though lacking significant news.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent underperformance and bearish sentiment at the start of September warrant a cautious stance, though current holdings limit downside action.

USDT: -0.4 — With market conditions favoring riskier assets, there is a preference to reduce exposure to stablecoins in favor of potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-09-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive trend signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight uptick, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the U.S. dollar, providing further support for BTC. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact its use in certain financial operations. Solana and Dogecoin are both showing positive price movements, although Dogecoin has been identified as a top decliner recently. The stablecoin USDT remains stable, with no significant buy signals, indicating a potential shift in capital towards more volatile assets as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum and positive trend signals, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the dollar, making BTC more attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite regulatory concerns, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and trend signals. However, the potential SEC challenge tempers the score slightly.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is experiencing significant price increases and maintains strong technical indicators, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, Dogecoin's status as a top decliner and lack of significant news keeps it neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to take advantage of potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-09-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite seasonal bearish trends and potential macroeconomic support from upcoming U.S. data releases. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which could weigh on its performance. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing typical market fluctuations without significant news, although Dogecoin has been identified as a laggard among major cryptocurrencies. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a slightly weaker dollar, suggests a moderate risk-on environment, potentially favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite seasonal bearishness, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain strong, and potential macroeconomic support could bolster its price.

ETH: 0.0 — While technicals are positive, regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX's bankruptcy could create headwinds, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive technical signals and no adverse news suggest a modestly favorable outlook, supporting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent underperformance and lack of positive catalysts suggest a cautious approach, though current holdings should be maintained.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally positive risk environment and strong technicals across other assets, it may be prudent to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of higher-risk assets."
2024-09-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience around the $58.5K mark despite seasonally bearish trends and ETF outflows. Positive macroeconomic indicators, such as potential weakening of the U.S. dollar, could provide further support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact its short-term outlook. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit bullish technical signals, although Dogecoin has been a recent underperformer. USDT remains stable, but with no significant bullish signals, it serves as a safe haven amidst market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support suggest a favorable outlook, despite ETF outflows.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC create uncertainty, offsetting otherwise bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and no negative news make Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite positive technical signals, recent underperformance and bearish sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most major cryptocurrencies experiencing slight to significant price increases over the past few hours. Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic factors that could weaken the dollar, providing further support for BTC. Ethereum is also experiencing a price increase, although news about potential SEC actions against FTX's use of ETH in creditor distributions introduces some uncertainty. Solana is showing strong technical indicators with significant price increases, although there is no major news to further support this momentum. Dogecoin, despite a recent price increase, is still affected by bearish sentiment as it was recently among the top decliners. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum in price and on-chain activity, coupled with potential macroeconomic support, makes BTC attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite potential regulatory concerns, ETH's significant price increase and bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Significant price increases and strong technical indicators make SOL appealing for increased allocation, despite the lack of major news.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent price increase is offset by previous bearish sentiment and low on-chain activity, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and buy signals from technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight increase in price, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the U.S. dollar. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which may dampen its appeal despite positive technical signals. Solana and Dogecoin are both showing bullish momentum, although Dogecoin has been identified as a top decliner in recent news. USDT remains stable, with no significant news or technical signals suggesting a shift in its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support make it an attractive asset, despite ETF outflows.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum, regulatory concerns regarding the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts introduce caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana maintains strong technical indicators and volume, with no negative news impacting its outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical signals, recent news of Dogecoin being a top decliner tempers enthusiasm, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive momentum in other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-09-02 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and technical indicators suggesting potential upward movement. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight uptick despite ETF outflows, and upcoming U.S. economic data could further influence its trajectory. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which may impact its price stability. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive price movements, although Dogecoin has been identified as a top decliner in recent sentiment shifts. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment, although the U.S. dollar's strength may pose some headwinds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and potential macroeconomic support could drive further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX payouts in Ethereum creates mixed sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish technical signals and no negative news suggest a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite recent price increases, Dogecoin's status as a top decliner and low on-chain activity suggest caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-09-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could introduce uncertainty. Solana shows stable technical indicators without any significant news impact. Dogecoin is lagging, with recent declines amid a bearish sentiment at the start of September. USDT remains stable, with no significant news or technical signals suggesting a shift in its role as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite ETF outflows.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts in ETH introduces risk, balancing out the bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent technical strength and lack of negative news make Solana a moderately attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent declines and low on-chain activity suggest caution, but existing holdings limit the extent of reduction.

USDT: -0.4 — With the potential for a bullish shift in risk assets, reducing USDT exposure slightly to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2024-09-03 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, despite recent volatility and a broader market dip linked to U.S. stock weakness and inflation concerns. Bitcoin's institutional outlook remains positive, with potential ETF inflows providing a long-term bullish scenario. Ethereum shows signs of accumulation by large holders, with technical indicators suggesting a possible breakout. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and strong performance despite large outflows, while Dogecoin's legal challenges have been dismissed, potentially stabilizing sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable oil and gold prices, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a strategic allocation into riskier assets while maintaining some caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, supported by institutional interest in ETFs, suggest a favorable outlook despite recent price dips.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout provide a moderately positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to recent price pressure.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite large outflows, SOL's strong performance and positive sentiment around decentralization efforts support a bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal issues resolved but no strong catalysts for upward movement; maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall bullish sentiment and signals across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum, supported by institutional interest in BTC ETFs, despite recent market dips linked to broader economic concerns. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for a breakout, although it faces some selling pressure. Solana continues to perform well, maintaining strong decentralization claims and showing resilience despite significant outflows. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with legal issues resolved and some community interest in new ICOs. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news regarding institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggest a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Accumulation by whales and potential breakout signals provide a moderately positive outlook, though some caution is warranted due to selling pressure.

SOL: +0.6 — Despite large outflows, Solana's strong performance and decentralization claims support a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some community interest in new ICOs, the overall sentiment remains neutral with no significant changes in data or news.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile cryptocurrencies."
2024-09-03 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite recent market dips, particularly in BTC due to broader economic pressures, institutional interest remains strong, particularly in BTC ETFs. Ethereum shows signs of potential breakout from a technical pattern, while Solana continues to demonstrate resilience despite large outflows. Dogecoin has seen legal clarity with the dismissal of a manipulation lawsuit, although community sentiment remains mixed. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively high volatility index, suggests a cautious approach, but the bullish signals in crypto markets indicate potential for upward movement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for recovery. The ETF news provides a long-term bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by large holders and technical patterns indicate a possible breakout. However, the current price is below key resistance levels, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Consistently positive technical indicators and strong performance despite outflows make SOL attractive. The defense of its decentralization adds confidence.

DOGE: 0.0 — While legal clarity is a positive, the community's mixed sentiment and lack of significant bullish news keep DOGE neutral for now.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-09-03 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, despite recent price fluctuations. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as inflation pressures and stock market weakness, yet institutional interest remains strong, particularly with the potential for BTC ETFs. Ethereum is showing signs of a potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, with whale accumulation indicating confidence. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and growth despite large outflows, while Dogecoin's recent legal dismissal may stabilize sentiment. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, BTC maintains strong institutional interest and bullish momentum, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Technical indicators suggest a potential breakout, supported by whale accumulation, though recent price decreases warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance despite outflows and positive sentiment from decentralization defense, indicating robust growth potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with recent legal news providing stability, but no strong signals for significant movement.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-09-03 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most cryptocurrencies, despite recent price volatility. Bitcoin's price has experienced a slight decline, influenced by broader market dips and inflation concerns, but institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a positive long-term factor. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for upward movement, although it faces technical resistance. Solana continues to perform well, supported by strong fundamentals and community confidence in its decentralization. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed, with legal news providing some relief but overall bearish sentiment persists. USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price drops, bullish momentum and institutional interest in ETFs suggest potential for recovery. On-chain activity remains strong.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential breakout from technical patterns indicate a positive outlook, though resistance levels need to be watched.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance and community confidence in decentralization make it an attractive option, with positive momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment and lack of strong catalysts keep DOGE in a neutral position, despite legal relief.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in other assets, a rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has shown strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum, supported by positive institutional outlooks on BTC ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for upward movement, though technicals indicate mixed signals. Solana maintains a strong performance despite large outflows, with its decentralization efforts being highlighted. Dogecoin's legal challenges have been resolved, but the sentiment remains bearish with community interest shifting to new ICOs. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum, coupled with positive institutional sentiment, make BTC attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout suggest moderate upside potential, though mixed signals warrant caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite outflows, Solana's strong performance and decentralization efforts provide a positive outlook, supporting moderate capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal resolution provides some stability, but bearish sentiment and community interest in other opportunities suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, capital rotation away from stablecoins is advisable."
2024-09-03 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks, which have impacted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite this, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, particularly with the potential inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum shows signs of accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for a breakout despite current technical pressures. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and strong performance, even amidst large outflows, while Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment but benefits from legal clarity with the dismissal of a manipulation lawsuit. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and positive ETF news provide a bullish outlook. However, macroeconomic pressures warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout suggest a positive outlook, but current technical pressures and macroeconomic factors advise a moderate approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued strong performance and resilience against outflows, coupled with positive sentiment from decentralization defense, make SOL attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal clarity offset by bearish trading conditions and community interest in alternatives. No strong directional signal.

USDT: -0.4 — As market conditions stabilize and risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is expected, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-09-03 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish technical indicators despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a dip due to macroeconomic pressures, but institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains strong, suggesting potential long-term inflows. Ethereum is showing signs of accumulation by large holders, although it is facing technical resistance. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and growth despite past outflows, supported by strong decentralization claims. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed, with legal issues resolved but community interest shifting towards new opportunities. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong dollar, suggests a cautious approach, favoring assets with strong fundamentals and potential for growth.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, institutional interest in BTC ETFs and strong on-chain activity provide a positive outlook. The macroeconomic environment suggests caution, but BTC's long-term potential remains attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout signals a cautious buy, though current resistance levels warrant a moderate approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance and positive news regarding decentralization support a bullish stance. SOL's resilience and growth potential make it a favorable choice in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal issues resolved but no strong bullish indicators. Community interest in new ICOs suggests a wait-and-see approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into growth assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-09-03 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with some bearish pressure due to macroeconomic factors such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks, which has impacted Bitcoin's price. However, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, particularly with the potential for significant inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is showing signs of potential bullish breakout patterns, although it faces seller pressure.

Dogecoin has faced bearish sentiment but received a slight boost from the dismissal of a manipulation lawsuit. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and bullish ETF projections provide a positive outlook. On-chain activity is also supportive.

ETH: +0.3 — While technicals are mixed, accumulation by whales and potential breakout patterns suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued resilience and strong performance despite outflows, along with positive news on decentralization, make SOL attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with no significant changes in data or news, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted, but maintaining a moderate exposure for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and weakness in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has experienced a downturn, influenced by these broader market conditions, although institutional interest remains strong with potential ETF inflows. Ethereum shows signs of accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential bullish momentum despite current technical challenges. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience with strong performance despite significant outflows, and Dogecoin's sentiment is slightly negative, although recent legal news may provide some relief. USDT remains stable but shows no significant bullish signals, indicating a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests potential long-term bullishness. However, current macroeconomic conditions warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation and potential technical breakout provide a slightly positive outlook, but the current price range and seller pressure suggest a moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong performance and resilience against outflows, coupled with positive news on decentralization, make SOL an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal news provides some relief, but overall sentiment remains bearish with no strong signals for significant capital allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With no current holdings, USDT remains a safe haven, but the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets suggests reducing exposure in favor of growth opportunities."
2024-09-03 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows mixed signals, with a relatively high 10-Year Treasury Yield and elevated volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing a slight recovery from a recent slump, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite broader market pressures. Institutional interest in BTC remains strong due to potential ETF inflows. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, though technical indicators suggest potential for volatility. Solana has shown strong performance despite large outflows, and Dogecoin is experiencing renewed interest following legal clarity. USDT remains stable without significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent market dips, institutional interest and a strong buy signal from the short-term moving average suggest potential for upside. The macro environment supports a cautious but optimistic stance on BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and technical patterns indicating a possible breakout provide a moderately positive outlook. However, the lack of a clear bullish momentum signal tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong historical performance and positive sentiment from decentralization efforts make SOL attractive. The buy signal from the short-term moving average supports increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some community interest, the absence of strong technical or fundamental drivers suggests a neutral stance. The recent legal news provides stability but not enough to warrant increased exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the slight bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets. However, maintaining some liquidity in USDT is wise due to ongoing market volatility."
2024-09-03 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a slump due to macroeconomic pressures like rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains strong. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, with whales accumulating at current levels, indicating possible upward momentum. Solana has demonstrated resilience despite large outflows, supported by its decentralized network structure. Dogecoin is facing bearish sentiment, but recent legal news might provide some relief. The macroeconomic context suggests a cautious approach, with volatility and inflation concerns potentially impacting risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price pressure, institutional interest in BTC ETFs and a buy trend signal suggest potential for recovery. The macroeconomic environment, however, warrants caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Whales accumulating and technical patterns suggest a potential breakout, but current price levels and mixed signals indicate moderate confidence.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong performance despite outflows and positive sentiment from decentralization efforts support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal news provides some relief, but overall bearish sentiment and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish opportunities in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly to capitalize on risk assets seems prudent."
2024-09-03 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by a significant downturn in prices across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, which have all experienced notable declines in the past hour. This downturn is linked to broader market weakness, particularly in U.S. equities, and concerns over rising inflation pressures. Despite this, there are some bullish long-term indicators, such as institutional interest in BTC ETFs and whale accumulation in ETH, suggesting potential recovery opportunities. However, the immediate technical signals and recent price actions indicate caution is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop, the long-term institutional outlook remains positive, and the current price is near a potential support level. However, the immediate technical signals are not favorable, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH is trading near a critical support level, with mixed technical signals. The accumulation by whales suggests potential upside, but the current market conditions do not strongly support an increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL has experienced a significant price drop, and while there are positive long-term developments, the immediate technical and market conditions suggest reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE has shown some resilience with recent legal news, but the overall bearish market sentiment and lack of strong technical signals suggest maintaining the current position without increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk, given the lack of strong buy signals across other assets."
2024-09-03 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by a broader market dip linked to weakness in U.S. stocks and rising inflation pressures. Bitcoin has seen a significant price drop, influenced by these macroeconomic factors. However, institutional interest remains strong, with projections of substantial inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential support at lower price levels, although technical indicators show a possible breakout scenario. Solana has demonstrated resilience despite large outflows, while Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, although a recent lawsuit dismissal could provide some relief. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, the recent price drop and broader market weakness suggest caution. The macroeconomic context and technical indicators do not support a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout provide some optimism, but overall market conditions warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's resilience and strong performance despite outflows, along with positive news about decentralization, make it relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bearish sentiment and community interest in new opportunities. The recent lawsuit dismissal is a positive but not enough to warrant a strong allocation change.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-09-03 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. This downturn is largely attributed to broader market weakness linked to U.S. stock market declines and rising inflation concerns. Despite this, there are pockets of optimism, such as institutional interest in BTC ETFs and whale accumulation of ETH, suggesting potential long-term bullish scenarios. DOGE has seen increased on-chain activity, but sentiment remains bearish, with community interest shifting to new ICOs. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest in ETFs, the current price breakdown and broader market weakness suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.2 — While whale accumulation is a positive sign, the technical breakdown and seller pressure warrant a cautious stance. Reduce exposure slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite past strong performance, the current bearish market and technical breakdown suggest holding rather than increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased on-chain activity is countered by bearish sentiment and price breakdown. Maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-09-03 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, characterized by a significant downturn in crypto prices, driven by broader market weakness and inflation concerns. Bitcoin has fallen below the $58k mark, reflecting the broader crypto market slump, although institutional interest remains strong with potential ETF inflows. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, but technical indicators suggest potential for a breakout. Solana, despite recent price declines, maintains a strong performance over the past year and continues to emphasize its decentralization. Dogecoin is facing bearish sentiment, though community interest in new ICOs indicates some speculative activity. In this environment, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The bearish market sentiment and technical indicators suggest caution, despite long-term bullish institutional interest. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by large holders and potential technical breakout warrant a cautious increase in allocation, balancing short-term bearishness with long-term potential.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite recent declines, Solana's strong historical performance and commitment to decentralization provide a modestly positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal news and community interest in ICOs, but no strong directional signals warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for strategic reallocation when conditions improve."
2024-09-03 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bearish, with a notable slump in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin, which has been dragged down by broader market weakness and inflation concerns. Despite this, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with potential long-term inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is facing selling pressure but shows potential for a breakout from a technical pattern. Solana has demonstrated resilience despite large outflows, and Dogecoin's sentiment remains bearish, although legal clarity has been achieved with a lawsuit dismissal. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT may see increased demand as investors seek safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The market slump and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, although long-term institutional interest provides some support. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with technical pressure and whale accumulation balancing each other out. Maintain current exposure until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, Solana's strong performance over the past year and defense of its decentralization narrative provide a slight positive bias.

DOGE: -0.5 — Bearish sentiment and lack of positive catalysts suggest reducing exposure, especially given the small current holding.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, increasing USDT holdings provides a safer allocation, allowing flexibility for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with a recent slump in crypto prices linked to broader market dips and rising inflation concerns. Bitcoin is under pressure, trading below $58k, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a long-term bullish factor. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential support around current levels, despite technical pressures. Solana remains resilient, showing strong performance despite large outflows and decentralization concerns. Dogecoin's sentiment is bearish, with legal issues resolved but community interest shifting towards new opportunities. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggesting a mixed risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests potential long-term inflows. However, caution is warranted due to current market weakness.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout provide a slightly positive outlook, though the market remains under pressure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong performance and resilience despite outflows and decentralization concerns make Solana relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With legal issues resolved but bearish sentiment prevailing, there is no clear signal to increase or decrease exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — In a mixed risk environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent, but a slight reduction is warranted to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."
2024-09-03 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with a mix of bearish and neutral signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a decline below $58,000, influenced by broader market dips and inflation concerns, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains strong. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, with increased whale accumulation providing some bullish undertones. Solana has demonstrated resilience despite large outflows, maintaining a strong performance over the past year. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, although recent legal dismissals may provide some relief. The macroeconomic environment, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stablecoins like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests a potential for long-term inflows, warranting a cautious positive stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation and technical patterns indicate a possible breakout, though current price levels remain subdued.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong historical performance and resilience against outflows highlight its potential, supported by positive news on decentralization.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal news providing some support, but overall bearish market conditions limit upside potential.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the cautious market environment, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-09-03 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with macroeconomic factors like rising inflation pressures and a dip in U.S. stocks impacting the crypto market. Bitcoin has experienced a decline below $58k, influenced by broader market weakness, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a positive long-term factor. Ethereum shows potential for a technical breakout, with large holders accumulating near key support levels. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience despite large outflows, supported by its decentralization narrative. Dogecoin has seen legal clarity with a lawsuit dismissal, but sentiment remains bearish as it trades below $0.10. There is no significant news affecting Tether, which remains stable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests a positive long-term outlook. However, current market conditions warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by large holders and potential technical breakout offer a slightly positive outlook, though the market remains under pressure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong performance and resilience amid outflows, coupled with positive decentralization news, make it relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit provides some relief, but overall sentiment remains bearish, keeping the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — In the current cautious market environment, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent, but a slight reduction is warranted to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."
2024-09-03 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has been affected by these broader market conditions, trading below $58k, but there remains a bullish institutional outlook with potential inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum shows signs of potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, supported by whale accumulation.

Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, though legal clarity and community interest in new ICOs provide some support. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests a long-term bullish outlook. However, current market conditions warrant caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation and technical patterns indicate potential for a breakout, but the current price level remains under pressure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong historical performance and resilience to outflows make SOL relatively attractive, especially with ongoing discussions around decentralization.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal clarity and community interest in new projects provide some support, but overall sentiment remains bearish.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintaining a neutral stance on USDT as a stable asset in a mixed market environment, with no significant news to drive allocation changes."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks impacting crypto prices. Bitcoin has experienced a decline below $58k, influenced by these broader market conditions, despite a long-term bullish outlook from institutional investors regarding BTC ETFs. Ethereum shows potential for a technical breakout, supported by whale accumulation, but faces seller pressure. Solana remains resilient despite large outflows, with its decentralization efforts highlighted. Dogecoin sentiment is bearish, with community interest shifting towards new opportunities. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price decline, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests a longer-term bullish outlook. However, current market conditions warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.1 — Whale accumulation and potential technical breakout provide some support, but seller pressure and current price levels suggest a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's resilience and decentralization efforts, along with its historical outperformance, make it relatively attractive despite market outflows.

DOGE: 0.0 — With bearish sentiment and a lack of significant positive catalysts, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-09-03 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious, with a recent slump in crypto prices linked to broader market weakness and inflation concerns. Bitcoin has dipped below $58k, influenced by these macroeconomic factors, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a long-term bullish signal. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical pattern, with whale accumulation suggesting confidence at current levels. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience despite large outflows, supported by a strong narrative of decentralization. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment but benefits from legal clarity following a dismissed lawsuit. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite the recent price dip, institutional interest in BTC ETFs provides a bullish long-term outlook. However, current technical indicators suggest caution.

**ETH: +0.2** — Whale accumulation and potential technical breakout offer a positive outlook, though recent price decreases warrant a measured approach.

**SOL: +0.4** — Strong performance despite outflows and a positive narrative on decentralization support a favorable allocation.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Mixed sentiment with legal clarity balanced by bearish price action; no strong directional signal.

**USDT: +0.1** — Given the current market uncertainty, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
