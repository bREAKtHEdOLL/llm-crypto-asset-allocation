2024-08-28 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, characterized by a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, driven by liquidation events and weak investor demand. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, exacerbated by a liquidation wave and external pressures from AI data centers acquiring energy assets. Ethereum is facing challenges with outflows from spot ETFs and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Despite Solana's record daily usage, its price has been under pressure, reflecting broader market corrections. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is affected by scam alerts, which could impact investor confidence. In contrast, Tether (USDT) shows bullish momentum, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and external pressures from energy demands suggest a cautious approach. Despite increased on-chain activity, the bearish technical indicators and macroeconomic context do not support a buy signal.

ETH: -0.5 — The significant outflows from spot ETFs and the Ethereum Foundation's sell-off indicate weak investor confidence. The bearish technical signals further support a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana's price is under pressure, the record daily active users suggest underlying strength. A modest positive score reflects potential for recovery if broader market conditions stabilize.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite scam alerts, there are no significant changes in technical indicators or market sentiment to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent. Its bullish momentum and stability provide a safe haven amid market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, characterized by a significant downturn in prices across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. This downturn is exacerbated by a broader market sell-off, as evidenced by the liquidation wave impacting Bitcoin. Ethereum faces additional pressure due to weak investor demand for spot ETFs and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Despite these challenges, Solana's network activity remains robust, with record daily active users, although its price continues to struggle. The macroeconomic backdrop, with moderate volatility and stable gold and oil prices, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability over risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The significant price decrease and liquidation wave indicate bearish sentiment. The lack of bullish technical signals suggests caution.

ETH: -0.5 — Weak investor demand and substantial sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation contribute to a negative outlook, despite stable on-chain activity.

SOL: 0.0 — While network activity is strong, the price remains under pressure, and the current holding suggests maintaining the position without increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in price or sentiment, coupled with low on-chain activity and scam alerts, warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for potential re-entry into riskier assets when conditions improve."
2024-08-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant liquidation wave and Ethereum facing weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and the Ethereum Foundation's selloff. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong network activity with record daily usage, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin is relatively stable but has been affected by scam alerts, which could impact investor confidence. In this environment, USDT remains a stable choice, reflecting a cautious market stance amid broader market corrections.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and energy asset acquisition by tech firms suggest bearish sentiment and potential downward pressure on Bitcoin prices.

ETH: -0.4 — Continued selloff by the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand indicate bearish sentiment, warranting reduced exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price weakness, record daily active users suggest underlying strength, justifying a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, with scam alerts potentially offsetting any positive momentum.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent to mitigate risk and preserve capital."
2024-08-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies indicates a bearish trend, with most assets experiencing slight decreases in price and technical indicators not showing strong buy signals. Bitcoin has faced a significant liquidation wave, and Ethereum is seeing weak investor demand, as evidenced by ETF outflows and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong user engagement, which could be a positive sign for future recovery. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has been relatively stable but faces risks from scam alerts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, suggesting it might be a safe haven in the current market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The macro environment does not currently support aggressive risk-taking in BTC.

ETH: -0.4 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate bearish sentiment. The lack of positive technical indicators further supports reducing exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana shows strong user engagement, the price has been weak, and technical indicators do not provide a clear buy signal. Holding current exposure seems prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite scam alerts, DOGE has shown stability in price. However, there are no strong buy signals or positive news to justify increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is advisable. The lack of significant news and its stable nature make it a safe choice in uncertain conditions."
2024-08-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish signals and some isolated bullish indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a significant liquidation wave, contributing to a broader market sell-off, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand and notable sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite price weakness, shows robust on-chain activity with record daily usage, indicating underlying interest. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is marred by scam alerts, which could affect investor confidence. USDT remains stable with no significant news, but its technical indicators suggest a bullish momentum in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and energy concerns create a bearish outlook despite some price stability. No current holdings allow for a neutral to slight negative stance.

ETH: -0.4 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation contribute to a bearish sentiment. The lack of current holdings supports a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite price weakness, the record high in daily active users suggests underlying strength and potential for recovery. Current holdings justify a positive allocation score.

DOGE: 0.0 — The absence of significant technical or on-chain activity changes, coupled with scam alerts, suggests a neutral stance with no current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite bullish technical indicators, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent given the broader market uncertainty, supporting a slight positive allocation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.11. The broader market sentiment is cautious, with the S&P 500 maintaining a high level, but the crypto market is experiencing a slight bearish trend. Bitcoin has been affected by a significant liquidation wave, and Ethereum is facing weak investor demand, as highlighted by ETF outflows and large sales by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price weakness, shows strong user engagement, which could indicate underlying strength. Dogecoin remains stable but is affected by scam alerts, while Tether remains a safe haven with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and energy asset sales by miners suggest bearish sentiment. Without current holdings, no reduction is possible, but caution is advised against new allocations.

ETH: -0.4 — The Ethereum Foundation's significant sell-off and ETF outflows indicate weak demand and potential for further downside. Avoid new positions until sentiment improves.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite price weakness, the record daily active users suggest strong underlying network activity, warranting a cautious buy signal to capitalize on potential recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in market data or sentiment, and scam alerts create uncertainty. Maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-08-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a recent dip in Bitcoin prices driven by a wave of liquidations and broader market sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing weak investor demand, as evidenced by significant outflows from spot ETFs and the Ethereum Foundation's large sell-off. Solana, despite a price decline, shows strong user engagement with record daily active users. Dogecoin faces security concerns with a scam alert, while Tether remains stable without significant news. Macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility, suggest a neutral to slightly bearish environment, prompting a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price dip and liquidation-driven sell-off, there are no strong technical buy signals or significant bullish news to justify increased exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and the Ethereum Foundation's sell-off indicate bearish sentiment, warranting caution and reduced exposure if held.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong user engagement and activity despite price weakness suggest potential for recovery, justifying a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Security concerns due to scam alerts and lack of significant bullish news or technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a cautious market environment with bearish signals for major cryptocurrencies, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-08-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by a wave of liquidations, particularly impacting Bitcoin, which has seen a significant price drop below $58k. This is compounded by broader market sell-offs and specific negative news for Ethereum, such as large outflows from spot ETFs and significant sales by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price weakness, shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet, with no major positive catalysts, while Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and energy concerns from AI data centers suggest continued downward pressure. Without current holdings, a negative score is not applicable.

ETH: -0.5 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation contribute to a bearish outlook, suggesting reduced exposure if held.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price declines, strong on-chain activity and record user engagement provide a slight positive outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant positive catalysts and ongoing scam alerts, maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-08-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with a recent wave of liquidations impacting Bitcoin and a broader market sell-off. Bitcoin's price has shown volatility, with significant liquidations and external pressures from AI data centers affecting mining operations. Ethereum is experiencing weak investor demand, as evidenced by spot ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite price weakness, is seeing record daily usage, indicating strong network activity. Dogecoin is facing security concerns with scam alerts, while Tether remains stable with no significant news. Overall, the market is experiencing mixed signals with some bearish pressures and isolated bullish activity in network usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility and liquidation events, there is no clear buy or sell signal. The macroeconomic environment and technical indicators suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate bearish sentiment. Technical indicators do not support a bullish position.

SOL: +0.5 — Record daily usage and strong on-chain activity suggest potential upside despite recent price weakness. Current holdings warrant maintaining or slightly increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in market data or sentiment, aside from security concerns, which do not directly impact price action.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market volatility and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown recent price increases, but the broader market remains cautious due to recent liquidation events and weak investor demand for Ethereum ETFs. Solana has seen a surge in daily active users, indicating strong network activity despite recent price weakness. Dogecoin is experiencing low on-chain activity, and there are no significant developments for Tether, which remains a stable option amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Recent price increases and bullish momentum suggest a potential upward trend, despite broader market sell-off concerns. The liquidation news is a cautionary note but doesn't outweigh the positive momentum.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent price gains, the outflows from spot ETFs and the Ethereum Foundation's sell-off create uncertainty, balancing the bullish momentum signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity with a record number of daily active users supports a positive outlook, even as the price remains under pressure. This suggests potential for a rebound.

DOGE: 0.0 — Low on-chain activity and lack of significant news or technical signals result in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the recent bullish momentum in other assets, it's reasonable to reduce stablecoin holdings slightly to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere, while still maintaining some stability in the portfolio."
2024-08-28 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects a mixed sentiment with some bearish undertones. Bitcoin experienced a significant liquidation wave, leading to a dip below $58k, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as indicated by spot-ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong on-chain activity with record daily active users, suggesting underlying network strength. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant positive developments, while Tether continues to serve as a safe haven with no major news impacting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price recovery, the liquidation wave and energy concerns pose risks. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to mitigate potential downside.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bearish news on ETF outflows and sell-offs, but some bullish momentum in technicals. Maintain a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and user growth offset recent price weakness, suggesting potential for recovery. Increase exposure moderately.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant positive developments and ongoing scam alerts keep sentiment neutral. Hold current position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a safe haven is prudent."
2024-08-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish momentum seen in the recent price movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the broader market sell-off and liquidation events. Bitcoin has experienced significant liquidations and pressure from energy asset acquisitions by tech firms, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, although its price remains under pressure. Dogecoin's sentiment is neutral with no significant market-moving news, while Tether remains stable without any notable developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidation pressures, Bitcoin shows signs of recovery with bullish momentum and slight price increases. However, the macroeconomic context and energy concerns warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is overshadowed by weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation, suggesting potential downward pressure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage indicate underlying strength, despite recent price weakness. This suggests potential for recovery and growth.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment. The market remains neutral with no major developments affecting its outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and some bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with potential upside."
2024-08-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant liquidation wave, causing a dip in its price, although it maintains bullish momentum in technical indicators. Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, despite a recent price drop. Dogecoin has been relatively stable, but faces security concerns due to scam alerts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable indices, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidations, Bitcoin maintains bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and weak demand from spot ETFs indicate potential downside risk.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage suggest resilience and potential for price recovery, despite recent declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in market data or sentiment, with scam alerts being a minor concern.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market signals, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT as a hedge against volatility is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with a recent dip in Bitcoin's price driven by a wave of liquidations and broader market sell-off pressures. Ethereum is experiencing weak investor demand, highlighted by spot-ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows robust on-chain activity with record daily active users. Dogecoin faces security concerns due to a scam alert, while Tether remains stable with no significant news. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation events and energy concerns weigh on sentiment, despite bullish momentum signals. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation create a mixed outlook. No current holdings to adjust.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and high user engagement are positive, but price weakness persists. Maintain current exposure with a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Security concerns from scam alerts and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest a neutral stance. No current holdings to adjust.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market sentiment and recent sell-offs in major assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safer position."
2024-08-28 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of bearish and cautious sentiment, primarily driven by a recent wave of liquidations affecting Bitcoin, which has fallen below $58k. This has been compounded by broader market corrections, impacting other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana. Despite these price pressures, Solana's network activity remains robust, indicating underlying user engagement. Ethereum faces challenges with weak investor demand for its ETFs and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's market is relatively stable, although it faces security concerns due to scam alerts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns pose risks. A cautious approach is warranted given current holdings.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but weak ETF demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Neutral stance due to lack of holdings.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and user engagement despite price weakness suggest potential for recovery. Current holdings justify a positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Stable price action and lack of significant news warrant a neutral stance, especially with no current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment in the broader market, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven amid volatility."
2024-08-28 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be mixed, with some bearish undertones. Bitcoin is experiencing a sell-off driven by a liquidation wave and competition for energy resources, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and significant selling by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price weakness, shows strong user engagement, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin's market is relatively quiet, with no significant developments apart from a scam alert. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with no major news affecting its status. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar and low volatility, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the market dip and liquidation wave suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but negative sentiment from ETF outflows and large sell-offs. A neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong user engagement and bullish momentum suggest potential for recovery despite recent price weakness. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant market movement or news suggests maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further corrections, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2024-08-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 17.11) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. However, the crypto market is experiencing a mixed phase with Bitcoin facing a liquidation wave and Ethereum seeing significant outflows from spot ETFs, indicating potential investor caution. Solana's network activity remains strong despite price weakness, while Dogecoin is dealing with security concerns due to scam alerts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, highlighting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns suggest caution. Holding current exposure is prudent given the mixed sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, significant outflows from spot ETFs and large sales by the Ethereum Foundation suggest investor caution. Maintaining neutrality is advisable.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong network activity with record daily usage indicates underlying strength, but price weakness and potential support retest warrant a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the lack of significant positive news and security concerns from scam alerts suggest maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and the stable macroeconomic context, a slight preference for maintaining liquidity in USDT is justified to capitalize on potential market shifts."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip driven by a liquidation wave, which has also affected other cryptocurrencies. Despite this, Ethereum shows bullish momentum in technical indicators, although news of significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and spot-ETF outflows indicate potential investor caution. Solana is experiencing high on-chain activity and user engagement, despite a recent price drop. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but faces negative sentiment due to scam alerts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, but its role as a safe haven may be appealing in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and external pressures from AI data centers suggest caution. Holding a small position is prudent.

ETH: +0.2 — Bullish technical indicators are countered by negative news regarding ETF outflows and Foundation sell-offs. A cautious approach is warranted, but potential for rebound exists.

SOL: +0.5 — High on-chain activity and user engagement are positive signs, despite recent price weakness. The potential for recovery and growth supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, with scam alerts potentially dampening enthusiasm. Neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a strong position in USDT provides stability and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent liquidation waves impacting Bitcoin and broader market corrections affecting Solana and Ethereum. Despite these challenges, there are signs of resilience, such as Solana's record daily active users and Ethereum's continued bullish momentum in technical indicators. The macroeconomic backdrop remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant changes in major indices or commodities. News of Ethereum Foundation's large ETH transfer to Kraken and weak investor demand for Ether spot ETFs could weigh on Ethereum's short-term outlook. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidation-driven dips, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. However, macroeconomic factors and energy concerns temper enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.1 — Mixed signals with strong technical momentum but negative news from ETF outflows and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Caution is advised.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user activity and technical momentum, despite recent price weakness, indicate potential for upside. The asset's resilience in user engagement is a positive sign.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment. The recent scam alert does not materially impact the asset's fundamentals or technicals.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for recovery in other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-28 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bearish pressures evident, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, due to recent sell-offs and liquidation events. Bitcoin has faced a significant liquidation wave, and Ethereum has seen outflows from spot ETFs and sales by the Ethereum Foundation, indicating potential investor caution. Solana, despite price weakness, shows strong user engagement, which might suggest underlying resilience. Dogecoin's market is relatively stable, but recent scams have created some negative sentiment. The macroeconomic backdrop remains stable with moderate volatility, suggesting no immediate macro-driven shocks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation events and energy asset acquisitions by tech firms indicate potential downward pressure, despite some bullish momentum signals.

ETH: -0.2 — Continued sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand suggest caution, although technical indicators remain somewhat positive.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a price decline, record daily active users point to strong network activity, which could support price recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in market data or sentiment, but recent scam alerts warrant caution.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation could provide a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-28 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a notable dip driven by a liquidation wave, with on-chain activity surging despite the price decline. Ethereum faces weak investor demand as indicated by ETF outflows and a significant sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, although struggling with price weakness, shows strong user engagement with record daily active users. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant positive catalysts, while Tether maintains its role as a stable asset amid market fluctuations. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Continued sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand indicate potential for further downside. Reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong user engagement provides a positive signal despite price weakness. Maintain a moderate allocation to capture potential upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment. Maintain a neutral stance given the lack of clear catalysts.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven amid uncertainty."

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bullish momentum in technical indicators but also significant sell-offs and liquidation events affecting Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip due to a liquidation wave, while Ethereum is seeing outflows from spot ETFs and sales by the Ethereum Foundation, indicating potential bearish sentiment. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong user activity, suggesting underlying network strength. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant market-moving news, while Tether continues to serve as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns from AI data centers suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current volatility.

ETH: -0.5 — The Ethereum Foundation's large sell-off and ETF outflows indicate bearish sentiment. Reducing exposure is advisable as these factors may continue to weigh on price.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong daily active user growth suggests network resilience, even as price remains under pressure. Moderate buying is justified to capitalize on potential network strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market signals and potential bearish trends in major assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-08-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt, driven by a broader market sell-off and significant liquidations, particularly affecting Bitcoin. Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows resilience with record daily active users, suggesting underlying network strength. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, though it is marred by scam alerts. Tether remains a safe haven with no significant news impacting its stability. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets amidst uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns create a bearish outlook. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to mitigate risk.

**ETH: -0.2** — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggest caution. Maintain a reduced position while monitoring for potential recovery signals.

**SOL: +0.3** — Strong network activity and user growth provide a positive outlook, despite recent price weakness. A moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

**DOGE: 0.0** — No significant changes in data or sentiment, coupled with scam alerts, suggest maintaining a neutral stance.

**USDT: +0.4** — Given the overall market uncertainty and bearish signals, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safer position to preserve capital and wait for clearer market signals."
2024-08-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bearish pressures due to recent liquidation waves and weak investor demand in Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin has experienced significant liquidations, and Ethereum is seeing outflows from its spot ETFs, indicating cautious investor sentiment. Solana, despite a recent price drop, shows strong on-chain activity with record daily active users, suggesting underlying network strength. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but faces challenges with scam alerts impacting sentiment. Tether remains steady with no significant news, reflecting its role as a stable asset in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns for miners suggest caution. The market sentiment is currently bearish, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — The significant outflows from spot ETFs and the Ethereum Foundation's selloff indicate weak investor confidence, suggesting a need to reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage provide a positive outlook despite recent price weakness, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant positive or negative developments, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies and the need for stability, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to hedge against potential further declines."
2024-08-29 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral risk environment. Bitcoin shows bullish momentum despite lacking a clear trend signal, and analysts warn of potential price shocks due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is struggling to break past resistance, with expectations of a delayed breakout. Solana is experiencing high user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could be bullish. Dogecoin has seen a positive legal outcome, which might boost sentiment, but its technical indicators are mixed. USDT remains a stable option, with strong reserve backing, indicating trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a lack of a clear trend signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors make it relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technicals are strong with bullish momentum, but the resistance level and news of a delayed breakout suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — High user activity and potential Binance integration are positive indicators, supporting a higher allocation despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.1 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk is a positive development, but mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the relatively stable macro environment and potential for bullish moves in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on growth opportunities."

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across different assets. Bitcoin shows bullish momentum despite a lack of a clear trend signal, and analysts warn of potential price volatility due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum is experiencing resistance at $2,700, with potential delays in significant upward movement. Solana is seeing increased user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could be positive for its outlook. Dogecoin has seen a legal victory with the dismissal of a lawsuit, which might stabilize its sentiment. USDT remains a stable option, backed by strong reserve data, but might see reduced demand if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of a trend signal, bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic impacts suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations keep the outlook neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The legal news provides some stability, but with no significant changes in technical indicators, the allocation remains neutral.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains stable and well-backed, a slight reduction is justified to allocate more capital to riskier assets with positive momentum."
2024-08-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally risk-on sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin shows bullish momentum despite a lack of trend confirmation, while Ethereum faces resistance and potential delays in upward movement. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users, which could be a bullish signal, especially with potential Binance integration rumors. Dogecoin has seen a legal win, which could stabilize sentiment, but on-chain activity remains low. USDT maintains strong reserves, indicating trust in its stability, but in a bullish environment, capital might rotate out of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a clear trend signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors make it relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum faces resistance, its consistent bullish momentum and buy signals suggest a modest positive outlook, though less strong than BTC.

SOL: +0.7 — The increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration provide strong bullish signals, making Solana the most attractive asset currently.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit provides stability, but low on-chain activity and lack of significant news keep it neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — In a generally bullish sentiment environment, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-08-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is performing well, which may suggest a positive risk sentiment that could spill over into the crypto markets. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum despite a lack of a clear trend signal, and analysts are speculating on potential significant price movements due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant upward movement soon, while Solana is gaining traction with a record high in daily active users and potential new product offerings from Binance. Dogecoin received a boost in sentiment following the dismissal of a high-profile lawsuit, and Tether's strong reserve data reinforces its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite no clear trend signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors make it relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, but the resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations limit its immediate upside potential.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential Binance integration are positive indicators, suggesting increased interest and potential price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a positive sentiment boost, and bullish momentum supports a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the stable macro environment and positive sentiment in risk assets, maintaining current USDT levels is prudent, with no strong signal to increase or decrease exposure."
2024-08-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by a VIX of 15.65. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with Bitcoin showing bullish momentum despite lacking a strong trend signal, while Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700. Solana is witnessing a surge in daily active users, which could potentially lead to positive price action, especially with speculation around Binance's potential integration. Dogecoin's legal clarity following the lawsuit dismissal might stabilize its sentiment, although its on-chain activity remains low. USDT continues to demonstrate strong reserve backing, providing confidence in its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a strong trend signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and high on-chain activity suggest potential for upward movement, supported by macroeconomic stability.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum faces resistance, its consistent bullish momentum and buy signals indicate a cautiously optimistic outlook, though a breakout may be delayed.

SOL: +0.6 — The increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration are strong positive signals, suggesting Solana may outperform in the near term.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit provides legal clarity, but low on-chain activity and lack of significant price movement justify a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With the overall market showing signs of bullish momentum, a slight reduction in USDT holdings could be warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum signals despite mixed macroeconomic indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing increased on-chain activity, and there is speculation about potential price shocks due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with expectations of a breakout delayed until later in the year. Solana is seeing a surge in daily active users and potential integration with Binance, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin has received a boost from the dismissal of a significant lawsuit, while USDT remains stable with strong reserve backing, indicating confidence in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite no clear trend signal, the bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest potential upside, especially with the possibility of a price shock due to macroeconomic factors.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. The delayed breakout suggests a cautious approach, but current technicals support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — The increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration are strong bullish signals, despite the lack of a trend signal. These developments could drive future price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk is a positive sentiment driver, coupled with bullish momentum, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 index. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, but analysts warn of potential price shocks due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is seeing increased user activity, which could be bolstered by potential new integrations with Binance. Dogecoin has received a boost in sentiment following the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk. Tether remains stable with strong reserve backing, suggesting confidence in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential price shocks, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic uncertainties.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but resistance at $2,700 and the delayed breakout forecast suggest a neutral stance for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased daily active users and speculation around Binance integration provide a strong case for capital allocation, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from the lawsuit dismissal and consistent bullish momentum support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets and strong reserve backing, there is room to reduce USDT holdings to capitalize on growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and stable price regimes. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in on-chain activity, though analysts warn of potential volatility due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum is facing resistance, with a potential breakout delayed until later in the year. Solana is seeing increased user activity and speculation around new integrations, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, while Tether's strong reserve report reinforces its stability. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, favoring selective risk-on strategies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential volatility, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a favorable outlook. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic uncertainties.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum maintains bullish momentum, but resistance levels and delayed breakout expectations temper enthusiasm. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong user activity and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, despite recent price stagnation. Solana's ecosystem developments support a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive legal news and sustained bullish momentum signal a slight increase in allocation, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals across other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral risk appetite. Bitcoin shows bullish momentum, but analysts warn of potential volatility due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance, with no significant breakout expected soon. Solana's user activity is at a high, potentially boosted by speculation around Binance integration. Dogecoin has seen legal clarity with the dismissal of a major lawsuit, which could stabilize sentiment. Tether remains strong with proof of reserves, indicating trust in its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential volatility warnings, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal. 

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and normal activity, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.6 — High user activity and potential Binance integration create a strong case for increased allocation, despite price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Legal clarity and bullish momentum support a modest increase in allocation, though price changes remain minimal.

USDT: -0.4 — With a stable macro environment and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-29 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential price shock due to U.S. Federal Reserve liquidity injections, which could lead to significant price movements. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see a breakout until later in the year. Solana is gaining traction with a record high in daily active users and potential integration with Binance, which could drive future demand. Dogecoin has seen a positive legal outcome with the dismissal of a major lawsuit, potentially stabilizing its market perception. Tether remains a stable choice with strong reserve backing, as evidenced by Bitget's proof-of-reserves report.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite low on-chain activity, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing resistance and lacks immediate catalysts for a breakout, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in user activity and potential Binance integration provide strong support for Solana, making it an attractive buy.

DOGE: +0.3 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a major overhang, coupled with bullish momentum, justifying a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.2 — With bullish signals in other assets and a stable market environment, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and buy signals from short-term moving averages. Bitcoin is experiencing potential volatility due to macroeconomic factors, with analysts warning of a significant price adjustment. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, suggesting a potential delay in a breakout. Solana is gaining traction with a surge in daily active users and speculation about new integrations, which could drive interest. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, potentially stabilizing its market perception. Meanwhile, USDT remains a stable option, with strong reserve backing, but may see reduced demand as risk appetite grows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential volatility, BTC shows strong technical signals and bullish momentum, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations suggest a neutral stance for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong user activity and potential new integrations with Binance make Solana appealing, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive news from the legal front and consistent bullish momentum provide a mild buy signal, though it's less compelling than other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — As market conditions lean towards risk-on, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly in favor of more volatile assets seems prudent."
2024-08-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, potentially influenced by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. Federal Reserve liquidity injections. Ethereum, while showing bullish technicals, faces resistance and may not see a significant breakout until later in the year. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and speculation around potential new integrations, which could drive interest. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, while Tether's strong reserve backing reinforces its stability. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and potential macroeconomic influences suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The possibility of a price shock due to Federal Reserve actions adds to the bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum, the resistance at $2,700 and news suggesting a delayed breakout tempers enthusiasm. However, it remains a solid hold given the overall positive market sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive on-chain activity and speculation about new integrations with Binance provide a strong case for increased allocation to Solana, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, providing a slight positive sentiment boost, although technicals remain stable.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of bullish momentum, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation of capital into more volatile assets."
2024-08-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Dogecoin's recent legal victory might boost investor confidence, although its price action remains relatively stable. Meanwhile, USDT maintains its stability, with strong reserve backing reported by Bitget, but the overall market environment suggests a slight shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential breakout signals, coupled with macroeconomic factors, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — While bullish momentum is present, resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations temper enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased user activity and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal clarity and bullish momentum support a modest positive stance, though price action remains stable.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-29 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic catalysts such as U.S. Federal Reserve liquidity injections. Ethereum, while showing bullish technicals, faces resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is gaining traction with a peak in daily active users and potential new integrations, indicating strong network activity despite price stagnation. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, which may bolster investor confidence. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with strong reserve backing, but may see reduced demand as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential macroeconomic catalysts suggest further price appreciation. Current holdings should be increased to capitalize on this trend.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum's bullish technical indicators and overall market optimism warrant a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration signal strong network activity and future growth potential, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive legal news and bullish momentum support a slight increase in allocation, although the asset remains relatively volatile.

USDT: -0.4 — As market conditions favor riskier assets, a reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to allocate more capital to growth-oriented cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive momentum and technical indicators suggesting potential upward movement. Bitcoin is experiencing a breakout, supported by bullish momentum and on-chain activity, although analysts warn of potential volatility due to macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year, while Solana benefits from increased user activity and potential Binance integration, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin has seen a legal overhang removed, which might stabilize sentiment, and Tether remains a reliable stablecoin with strong reserve backing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish signals with breakout potential and increased on-chain activity. However, be cautious of potential volatility due to macroeconomic factors.

ETH: +0.1 — While technicals are positive, resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations temper enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive user activity and potential Binance integration provide a strong bullish case despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Legal clarity and stable technical indicators support a modest positive outlook, though no major catalysts are present.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout scenario, supported by positive on-chain activity and market speculation regarding Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum faces resistance but maintains bullish technical indicators. Solana benefits from increased user activity and potential integration news, while Dogecoin sees a legal overhang removed, potentially boosting sentiment. USDT remains stable, with strong reserve backing, but may see reduced demand as investors seek higher returns from riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move, supported by macroeconomic factors and positive on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum maintains bullish technical indicators, suggesting potential for gradual upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration signal strong fundamentals, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal clarity and bullish momentum provide a modest positive outlook, though overall market impact remains limited.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-08-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by strong on-chain activity, although there are warnings of potential price shocks due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is witnessing increased user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin has seen a legal overhang removed, which might stabilize sentiment. Tether remains a stable choice with strong reserve backing, but its role in the portfolio should be balanced against the current bullish sentiment in other assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest a potential breakout, despite macroeconomic caution. Its relative strength warrants increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum faces resistance, its bullish momentum and technical signals justify a modest positive score, with potential for future gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's peak in daily active users and potential Binance integration are positive developments, supporting a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a negative overhang, but with no major catalysts, a slight positive score is appropriate.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-29 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout scenario, although analysts warn of possible price shocks due to macroeconomic factors like U.S. Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, with a potential delay in any significant breakout. Solana is gaining traction with a record high in daily active users, and speculation about new integrations could bolster its appeal. Dogecoin's legal clarity regarding Elon Musk's influence has removed some uncertainty, while Tether's robust reserve report enhances its stability perception. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a balanced approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and potential breakout, though caution is warranted due to macroeconomic warnings. Maintain a positive outlook with moderate confidence.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish signals, resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations suggest a neutral stance. Hold current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased user activity and potential Binance integration create a favorable environment. Positive sentiment and technicals support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal clarity and bullish momentum provide a slight positive tilt, though lacking strong catalysts for a larger move. Consider small incremental increases.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential upward trends in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals despite recent price declines. Bitcoin is experiencing low on-chain activity, but analysts warn of potential volatility due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is gaining traction with a rise in daily active users and potential integration news from Binance, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin has seen legal clarity with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, which may stabilize sentiment. Meanwhile, Tether's strong reserve backing reinforces its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, BTC maintains bullish momentum signals and potential for significant moves due to macroeconomic factors. However, low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces resistance and lacks immediate bullish catalysts, with analysts predicting delayed upward movement. Current technicals suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in user activity and potential Binance integration provide a bullish outlook, despite recent price drops. These factors support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal clarity from the lawsuit dismissal provides stability, but recent price declines and lack of strong bullish signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With overall market conditions showing bullish momentum, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets."
2024-08-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing mixed signals; while technical indicators for major assets like BTC and ETH show bullish momentum, recent price actions have been volatile with significant fluctuations, particularly in BTC and SOL. News highlights potential catalysts for future movements, such as Federal Reserve actions impacting BTC and potential Solana integrations by Binance. The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a positive sentiment boost for DOGE. USDT remains a stable option, with strong reserve backing as shown by Bitget's proof-of-reserves report.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, BTC maintains bullish technical signals and potential for upward movement due to macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve actions.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces resistance and lacks immediate catalysts for a breakout, with technical indicators showing mixed signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news on user activity and potential Binance integration, coupled with a recent price dip, suggests a buying opportunity.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a positive sentiment boost, though technical indicators are mixed.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a stable option, the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets with bullish signals suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin shows potential for a significant price movement due to anticipated Federal Reserve liquidity injections, although on-chain activity remains low. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, with analysts predicting no major breakout until later in the year. Solana is experiencing high user activity, which could be bolstered by potential Binance integration, despite current price stagnation. Dogecoin has seen a legal win with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, which may stabilize sentiment. Tether remains a stronghold of stability, with Bitget's proof-of-reserves report reinforcing trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite low on-chain activity, the potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors makes BTC relatively attractive. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — With resistance at $2,700 and no immediate breakout expected, ETH remains a hold. The technicals suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration create a favorable outlook for Solana, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a slight positive sentiment boost, but technicals remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential for upward movements in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-08-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the S&P 500 showing stability and the U.S. Dollar Index remaining relatively low. This suggests a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin's market data indicates mixed signals with a potential for significant price movement due to macroeconomic factors, while Ethereum struggles to break resistance levels. Solana shows promising on-chain activity and potential integration with Binance, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin's recent legal victory may boost sentiment, but technical indicators remain neutral. Tether's strong reserve backing reinforces its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors and increased on-chain activity suggests a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — With resistance at $2,700 and no immediate breakout expected, Ethereum remains neutral. The current market conditions do not favor aggressive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential Binance integration suggest a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of a major lawsuit against Elon Musk may improve sentiment slightly, but technical indicators remain neutral. A cautious increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: -0.3 — With a stable macro environment and potential for risk-on sentiment, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to allocate capital to more promising assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral risk sentiment. Bitcoin shows mixed signals with potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors, while Ethereum faces resistance and may not see a breakout soon. Solana is experiencing high user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could be bullish. Dogecoin has seen a positive legal outcome, potentially boosting sentiment, while USDT remains stable with strong reserve backing, indicating trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — With resistance at $2,700 and no immediate breakout expected, maintain a neutral position.

SOL: +0.5 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from the lawsuit dismissal supports a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the stable macro environment and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, slightly reduce exposure to USDT."
2024-08-29 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. The U.S. dollar index is moderate, and gold prices are high, suggesting some risk aversion in broader markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin shows mixed signals with potential for a major price move due to macroeconomic factors, while Ethereum struggles with resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana's user activity is at a high, hinting at underlying strength despite price stagnation, and potential integration with Binance could be a positive catalyst. Dogecoin has seen a positive legal outcome, which might boost sentiment. Tether's strong reserve backing reinforces its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, the potential for a significant macro-driven price move and recent positive on-chain activity warrant a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — With resistance at $2,700 and no immediate catalysts, maintaining a neutral position is prudent until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user activity and potential Binance integration provide positive sentiment, suggesting an opportunity for capital allocation despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk could improve sentiment, but technicals remain neutral, justifying a modest increase.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for risk-on sentiment in the crypto market and strong backing, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly in favor of other assets seems appropriate."
2024-08-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a dip below $60K due to U.S. session weakness but also seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum's market activity is influenced by notable transactions by its co-founder, though it remains in a volatile state with ongoing debates about its network usage. Solana is showing strong network adoption with a record surge in daily active users, driven by its high-speed, low-cost advantages, particularly in the memecoin space. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a stable but uneventful period for these assets. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent dip, large wallet accumulation indicates reduced selling pressure and potential for a rebound.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from market activity and co-founder transactions suggest a wait-and-see approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and user growth highlight Solana's potential, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or market movement suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive signals in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a period of consolidation, with Bitcoin trading in a tight range and Ethereum showing signs of accumulation by large holders. Solana is benefiting from increased network activity and adoption, while Dogecoin and Tether remain relatively stable without significant news impacts. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing potential for upward movement, particularly Solana due to its increased user engagement and network activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite trading in a tight range, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish foundation, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from recent transactions by Vitalik Buterin and overall market sentiment suggest maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user growth indicate a positive outlook, making Solana an attractive option for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautious optimism in the market and potential for upward movement in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to reallocate capital into more promising assets."
2024-08-30 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin trading below $60K, influenced by U.S. session weakness, though large wallets are accumulating, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Ethereum shows mixed signals with Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions and ongoing debates about network activity versus broader interest. Solana is experiencing positive momentum with record daily active users and increased adoption due to its high-speed, low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, with Dogecoin showing slight bullish momentum in technicals. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation, though caution is warranted given the current price weakness.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from recent transactions by Vitalik Buterin and ongoing debates about network activity keep Ethereum in a neutral position.

SOL: +0.5 — Record daily active users and strong network adoption highlight Solana's potential, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.1 — Slight bullish momentum in technical indicators, but lack of significant news keeps Dogecoin's outlook modestly positive.

USDT: -0.2 — With some positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities."
2024-08-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin trading in a tight range and showing signs of accumulation by large holders, which could indicate a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals, with recent on-chain activity and Vitalik Buterin's movements causing mild reactions. Solana is showing strong network adoption with a record surge in daily active users, highlighting its potential for growth. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable position in the current market environment. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent dip below $60K, accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish setup. The market is showing resilience, and BTC remains a core holding.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from on-chain activity and market reactions to Vitalik's movements suggest a neutral stance. The asset is stable but lacks a clear directional signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and increased user activity provide a positive outlook. Solana's technical advantages continue to attract interest, making it a preferred allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold. The lack of momentum or news keeps it neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With signs of accumulation in BTC and positive developments in SOL, there is a slight preference to rotate some capital out of stablecoins into these assets. However, maintaining a stablecoin reserve is prudent given market uncertainties."
2024-08-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bearish undertone. Bitcoin is experiencing a dip below $60K, driven by U.S. session weakness, although large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum is seeing some volatility, with notable transactions from Vitalik Buterin indicating strategic repositioning, while Solana is gaining traction with record daily active users and increased interest in its ecosystem due to its high-speed, low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether remain relatively stable with no significant news impacting their market dynamics. Overall, the market is showing signs of cautious optimism, with some assets displaying potential for growth amid broader market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation. However, the lack of a clear technical buy signal tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent strategic moves by Vitalik Buterin and ongoing volatility. The market remains undecided, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network activity and user growth highlight Solana's potential. The recent record in daily active users and memecoin interest support a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market context.

USDT: -0.3 — In light of potential bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities elsewhere."
2024-08-30 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a slight dip below $60K due to U.S. session weakness, although large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum has seen some volatility, with notable transactions by co-founder Vitalik Buterin, but remains under pressure despite a recent rebound. Solana is gaining traction with a record surge in daily active users and increased interest in its ecosystem, highlighting its high-speed, low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a relatively stable environment for these assets. Overall, the macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a cautious but potentially opportunistic market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, large wallet accumulation indicates potential for upward movement, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from technical indicators and recent market activity suggest a neutral stance, with no strong impetus for change.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network activity and user adoption provide a positive outlook, making Solana relatively attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the potential for bullish movement in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings may be prudent to free up capital for more dynamic assets."
2024-08-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders despite recent price dips. Ethereum's market activity is influenced by significant transactions from its co-founder, which may signal caution. Solana is gaining traction with increased daily active users and network adoption, driven by its high-speed, low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether remain relatively stable with no significant news impacting their market dynamics. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with potential bullish signals emerging for certain assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish foundation, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from significant transactions by Vitalik Buterin and ongoing volatility suggest a neutral stance as the market digests these developments.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and increased daily active users highlight Solana's growth potential, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market dynamics results in a neutral stance for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — As some assets show potential bullish signals, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings may be warranted to capitalize on emerging opportunities."
2024-08-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased interest in risk assets like SOL and BTC, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with some bullish undertones. Bitcoin is experiencing a tug-of-war between Asian buying and American selling, but large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum is seeing mixed signals with Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions causing mild reactions, while network activity remains a focal point. Solana is showing strong network adoption with record daily active users and a memecoin wave highlighting its competitive advantages. Dogecoin and USDT have no significant news, but DOGE shows technical bullish momentum. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no extreme movements in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, large wallet accumulation suggests reduced selling pressure and potential for upward movement.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from recent transactions and network activity; no clear directional bias.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and positive sentiment from increased daily active users and memecoin activity.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum signals in technical indicators, though lacking significant news to drive a stronger conviction.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market, some capital rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets is warranted."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight dip below $60K, but large holders are accumulating, which could indicate a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum is facing some volatility, with notable on-chain activity and strategic moves by its co-founder, which may influence market perception. Solana is showing strong network adoption with a record surge in daily active users, highlighting its competitive edge in speed and cost. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, maintaining their status quo. The macroeconomic indicators suggest a stable environment with moderate volatility, which might encourage a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent dip, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential for upward movement, making it relatively attractive.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from on-chain activity and recent strategic moves by Vitalik Buterin create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and positive sentiment from increased daily active users make Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Although there is no significant news, the technical indicators show bullish momentum, suggesting a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for bullish movement in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT could be beneficial to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."
2024-08-30 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders despite recent price dips below $60K. This suggests a potential bullish foundation as selling pressure reduces. Ethereum's market activity is mixed, with notable movements by its co-founder and ongoing debates about its network activity versus broader interest. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and memecoin activity, highlighting its network's strengths. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating stability in their respective markets. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable with low volatility, which may support gradual risk-taking in the crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, large wallet accumulation suggests a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic environment is stable, supporting gradual risk-taking.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent co-founder activity and debates on network usage. No clear directional bias at this time.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and new user records indicate positive sentiment and potential for growth, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in data, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With a stable macro environment and potential bullish signals in other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted."
2024-08-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of bullish momentum, particularly in Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin's price has been relatively stable, with large wallets accumulating, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent dips. Ethereum shows mixed signals, with significant movements by its co-founder and ongoing debates about its on-chain activity. Solana is experiencing strong network adoption, highlighted by a record surge in daily active users and increased interest in Solana-native memecoins. Dogecoin and Tether remain relatively stable with no significant news impacting their immediate outlook. Overall, the market appears to be in a phase of cautious accumulation, with potential for upward movement if macroeconomic conditions remain supportive.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong on-chain accumulation by large holders indicates potential for upward movement. The bullish momentum signal supports a moderate buy stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent co-founder activity and ongoing debates about network usage. The lack of strong momentum or trend signals justifies a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and positive sentiment from increased daily active users and memecoin activity suggest a favorable outlook. Bullish momentum supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintain a neutral stance on Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — As the market shows signs of cautious optimism, consider reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to allocate more capital towards assets with bullish potential."
2024-08-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent significant price decreases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL, which have all broken below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. However, BTC's large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation despite the recent dip. Ethereum's market activity is influenced by Vitalik Buterin's movements, and Solana is experiencing increased network adoption, highlighted by a record surge in daily active users. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX, which might suggest limited immediate pressure on crypto markets from traditional financial markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, the accumulation by large wallets and bullish momentum signals suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to the recent breakdown.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent significant price drop and Vitalik's transactions creating uncertainty. The market is still digesting these developments, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network adoption and bullish momentum, despite the recent price drop, suggest a positive outlook. The increased daily active users highlight growing interest and potential for recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral position. The market activity does not indicate a clear direction.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the recent volatility and price drops in other assets, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against further downside risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a dip below $60K, with significant accumulation by large wallets suggesting potential bullish sentiment despite recent price weakness. Ethereum shows signs of volatility, with notable movements by its co-founder impacting market perception. Solana is witnessing strong network adoption, highlighted by a surge in daily active users and interest in its ecosystem. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, but technical indicators suggest a cautious approach. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility in traditional markets, which could influence crypto sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large wallets and bullish on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent volatility and founder activity; no strong directional bias at present.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and positive ecosystem developments make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive sentiment in the broader crypto market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-30 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility impacting major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has shown some resilience with large holders accumulating, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips below $60K. Ethereum's market activity reflects some cautious sentiment, with notable transactions by its co-founder indicating strategic positioning amidst volatility. Solana is experiencing positive network activity, marked by a record surge in daily active users and increased interest in its ecosystem, particularly in memecoins. Dogecoin and Tether have not seen significant news, but DOGE's technical indicators suggest a lack of strong momentum. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, does not suggest immediate external pressures on crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders and bullish on-chain signals suggest potential for upward movement.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent strategic moves by key figures and ongoing volatility; no clear direction for allocation adjustment.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user adoption highlight Solana's growth potential, making it attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for bullish moves in BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings could be justified to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-08-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing price declines with no clear bullish signals from technical indicators, although Bitcoin's large wallet accumulation suggests potential support. Ethereum's market is reacting to Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions, adding to the uncertainty. Solana shows promising network activity with a record surge in daily active users, indicating strong adoption potential. Dogecoin and USDT remain relatively stable with no significant news or changes in market data. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a neutral backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, the accumulation by large wallets provides a bullish foundation, suggesting potential for a rebound.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent sell pressure and market reaction to Vitalik's transactions, maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network activity and user growth highlight Solana's potential, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish signals in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-08-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment shows a mixed picture with some bullish signals emerging amidst broader uncertainty. Bitcoin has seen a dip below $60K, driven by U.S. session weakness, but large holders are accumulating, which could indicate a bullish foundation. Ethereum has experienced significant price swings, with notable on-chain activity but mixed sentiment due to recent volatility. Solana is showing strong network adoption with record daily active users, highlighting its potential for growth. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a stable position. Tether remains a stable choice, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, accumulation by large holders suggests potential for a rebound. However, the lack of a clear upward trend keeps the score moderate.

ETH: +0.1 — Ethereum's recent price increase and on-chain activity are promising, but mixed sentiment and volatility warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network adoption and increased user activity provide a bullish outlook, making Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — While maintaining stability, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to capitalize on potential growth in other assets, particularly Solana."
2024-08-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some positive developments across various cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a consolidation phase with significant accumulation by large holders, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips. Ethereum has seen some volatility, with notable movements by its co-founder, but remains under pressure due to broader market interest waning. Solana is showing strong network activity and adoption, driven by a surge in daily active users and interest in Solana-native memecoins. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, but Dogecoin's price has shown slight increases. The macroeconomic context is stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, which may support risk-on sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish outlook. The market is consolidating, and this could be a good opportunity to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent volatility and the co-founder's actions have created mixed sentiment. However, the slight bullish momentum and network activity support a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and rising adoption, as evidenced by the record daily active users, make Solana an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and low on-chain activity, Dogecoin remains neutral. The slight price increase does not warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on risk-on opportunities in the crypto market."
2024-08-30 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with some positive developments. Bitcoin is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential bullish sentiment despite recent price dips below $60K. Ethereum's market activity is influenced by notable transactions from its co-founder, but overall network activity remains a point of interest for bulls. Solana is seeing increased adoption with record daily active users and a surge in memecoin activity, highlighting its network advantages. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, but Dogecoin's low on-chain activity suggests limited immediate interest. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a cautious but slightly optimistic outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Accumulation by large holders and stable on-chain activity provide a supportive backdrop despite recent price volatility.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum shows some positive momentum, the mixed sentiment from recent transactions and network activity suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong network adoption and increased user activity highlight Solana's growth potential, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.1 — Low on-chain activity and lack of significant news suggest a neutral to slightly negative stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive sentiment in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential upward movements in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.0. The U.S. dollar index is slightly lower, which could be supportive for cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing a mix of accumulation by large holders and some selling pressure, keeping it in a tight range. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum, supported by on-chain activity despite some selling by its co-founder. Solana is experiencing strong network growth and adoption, highlighted by a record in daily active users. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, but Dogecoin is showing bullish technical signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the tight trading range, accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish foundation. However, the lack of a clear trend signal tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive on-chain activity, despite some selling by a co-founder, indicate a favorable outlook. The network's resilience supports a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network growth and adoption, along with bullish momentum, make Solana particularly attractive. The recent record in daily active users underscores its potential.

DOGE: +0.2 — Although there is no significant news, the technical indicators are bullish, suggesting a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market showing signs of bullish momentum, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2024-08-31 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin's potential to reach $100K by year-end and Ethereum's expected rebound to $4,000 are driving positive sentiment. Solana's rapid growth and potential to rival payment giants like PayPal add to its attractiveness. However, macroeconomic indicators such as stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index suggest a stable environment, which may not yet fully support aggressive risk-taking. The absence of significant news for DOGE and USDT implies a neutral stance for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding potential price surge to $100K support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about a potential return to $4,000 justify a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued bullish momentum and positive sentiment about its scalability and growth potential support a moderate increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral market data suggest holding current positions without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-31 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, which suggests a conducive backdrop for risk assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing bullish momentum, supported by technical indicators and optimistic news forecasts, with Bitcoin potentially rallying to $100K and Ethereum to $4K. Solana is experiencing significant growth and is being compared to major payment platforms, indicating strong market interest. Dogecoin and USDT have no significant news, but DOGE maintains bullish technical signals. Overall, the market sentiment leans positive, with a focus on growth and potential upside for major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment with predictions of a significant price surge. The on-chain activity surge supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with optimistic news about price recovery to $4,000, make it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a buy signal, Solana's growth potential and comparison to major payment platforms suggest a favorable long-term outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, the technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on the bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-31 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The crypto market shows signs of bullish sentiment, particularly for major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are supported by positive momentum indicators and optimistic news forecasts. Bitcoin is showing a potential for significant upward movement, with predictions of reaching $100K by year-end. Ethereum also has a positive outlook, with expectations of returning to $4,000. Solana continues to be a strong performer, with comparisons to major payment platforms due to its scalability. Dogecoin and USDT have no significant news, but DOGE maintains bullish momentum, while USDT's breakout from the Bollinger Bands suggests a potential shift in capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment with predictions of a significant price increase. This aligns with the current market data, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical indicators are bullish, and the positive news sentiment supports a potential price rebound. This makes ETH an attractive asset, though slightly less so than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's consistent growth and scalability potential make it a strong candidate for increased allocation, supported by bullish momentum and positive market sentiment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, DOGE maintains bullish momentum. However, its relative attractiveness is lower compared to other assets, warranting a modest positive score.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a likely rotation out of stablecoins like USDT. The breakout from the Bollinger Bands suggests potential capital outflows, justifying a reduction in exposure."
2024-08-31 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is showing strong technical indicators with a potential rally towards $100K by year-end, supported by positive on-chain activity and bullish momentum signals. Ethereum is also displaying bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a potential rebound to $4,000, despite recent skepticism. Solana continues to show growth potential, with comparisons to major payment platforms highlighting its scalability. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, but Dogecoin maintains a bullish technical setup. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar, which may support risk-on sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and positive on-chain activity, supported by predictions of a significant price surge. It remains a key asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent skepticism, Ethereum's technical indicators are bullish, and the potential for a rebound to $4,000 makes it an attractive asset to hold and potentially increase exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's growth potential and strong technical indicators suggest it is a promising asset, with potential to rival major payment platforms, warranting a positive allocation score.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has a bullish technical setup, the lack of significant news or developments keeps it neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is showing potential for a significant rally, with predictions suggesting a surge toward $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound to $4,000, indicating positive sentiment despite recent skepticism. Solana continues to garner attention for its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar and low volatility in the S&P 500, supports a moderate risk-on environment, which may encourage capital allocation into cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news sentiment suggest potential for significant upside, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and optimistic price forecasts support a favorable outlook, though slightly less compelling than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued growth and scalability prospects make it an attractive option, though less immediate upside compared to BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a hold position with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is showing potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end, supported by strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards $4,000, driven by bullish momentum and analyst predictions. Solana continues to gain attention for its scalability and potential to compete with established payment systems, reflecting its strong growth trajectory. Despite the positive outlook for these assets, the macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news sentiment suggest a potential rally towards $100K, making BTC an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and analyst expectations of a rebound to $4,000 support a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued growth and scalability potential, along with positive market sentiment, make SOL a promising asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no immediate need to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, capital may rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, justifying a slight reduction in exposure."
2024-08-31 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which could be supportive for cryptocurrencies. Recent market data reveals a consistent bullish momentum across BTC, ETH, and SOL, with buy signals from technical indicators. News suggests potential significant upside for BTC and ETH, with predictions of BTC reaching $100K and ETH returning to $4K. Solana's growth is highlighted, suggesting strong future potential. DOGE and USDT lack significant news, and DOGE shows a slight decrease in momentum. Overall, the market sentiment leans towards a bullish outlook for major cryptocurrencies, with a focus on potential growth in BTC, ETH, and SOL.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment with predictions of significant price increases. On-chain activity shows potential for further growth.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical indicators and news suggesting a return to $4K. Despite recent skepticism, the overall sentiment is positive.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and positive news coverage highlighting its scalability and growth potential. 

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and a slight decrease in momentum suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, there is a potential rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-31 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with technical indicators and news suggesting potential upward movements. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both receiving positive forecasts, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $100K by year-end and Ethereum expected to rebound to $4,000. Solana continues to be highlighted for its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. Despite the positive outlook, the market has shown some recent price declines, indicating a cautious approach may be warranted. The macroeconomic context, including stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced risk approach, with potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news predicting a significant price increase by year-end make BTC an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and news suggesting a rebound to $4,000 support a moderate increase in ETH allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued growth and scalability potential, along with positive technical indicators, justify a slight increase in SOL exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed momentum signals suggest maintaining current DOGE holdings without adjustment.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital towards higher growth potential assets."
2024-08-31 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is showing strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment, with predictions of a potential rally towards $100K by year-end. Ethereum also has bullish momentum, with expectations of a rebound to $4,000. Solana continues to gain attention for its scalability and potential to rival major payment systems, although its recent price action is mixed. Dogecoin has no significant news, and its technical indicators are less clear. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a conducive environment for risk assets, although the strong U.S. dollar might pose some headwinds. In this context, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight tilt towards growth-oriented assets seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment suggest potential for significant upside. The prediction of a rally towards $100K adds to the bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about a potential rebound to $4,000 support a favorable allocation, although not as strong as Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite mixed recent price action, Solana's long-term growth potential and scalability keep it attractive, albeit with some caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment and technical indicators for major cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more towards growth assets is advisable."
2024-08-31 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a notable bullish outlook for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's potential to reach $100K by year-end and Ethereum's anticipated rebound to $4,000 reflect positive sentiment, supported by strong technical indicators and on-chain activity. Solana continues to attract attention due to its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, indicating a strong growth narrative. However, Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, suggesting a more stable or neutral outlook. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment about potential price surges suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin. Increased on-chain activity also supports this bullish stance.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and positive news about a potential price rebound to $4,000 indicate a strong buy signal for Ethereum. The technical indicators further reinforce this positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a buy signal in the latest hour, Solana's strong growth narrative and positive momentum suggest a moderate buy signal. The asset's potential to rival traditional payment systems adds to its attractiveness.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context indicates a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility (VIX at 15.18) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a generally positive sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing bullish momentum with strong buy signals from technical indicators, supported by optimistic news predicting significant price increases by year-end. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability potential, which could position it as a major player in the payments space. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, with DOGE showing no clear momentum and USDT maintaining its role as a stable asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news predicting a potential surge to $100K by year-end support a positive outlook. High on-chain activity further reinforces the buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technicals and news suggesting a rebound to $4,000 provide a favorable outlook. However, the increase is more moderate compared to BTC due to slightly lower on-chain activity.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite lacking a buy signal from the trend, Solana's potential to rival major payment systems and its strong growth narrative support a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, there is no compelling reason to adjust the current position.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, there is an opportunity to rotate capital out of USDT and into more growth-oriented assets."
2024-08-31 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by predictions of a potential rally to $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards the $4,000 mark, reflecting positive sentiment despite recent skepticism. Solana is gaining attention due to its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, which could drive further interest. However, Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, indicating a stable but less dynamic outlook for these assets. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and bullish news sentiment suggest a continued upward trajectory. The prediction of a potential rally to $100K adds confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and news suggesting a rebound to $4,000 support a moderately bullish outlook. Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite a lack of buy signals from trend indicators, Solana's potential to rival payment giants and its massive growth history make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust the current position.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of bullish momentum, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-31 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite slight recent price decreases. Bitcoin shows potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end, supported by strong on-chain activity and positive technical indicators. Ethereum, while experiencing a slight dip, is expected to rebound towards $4,000, as suggested by analysts. Solana continues to demonstrate impressive growth and scalability, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms, although its technical indicators remain mixed. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and its technical signals are neutral. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a mild shift from stablecoins like USDT towards more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent price fluctuations, strong on-chain activity and bullish sentiment from predictions of a year-end rally support a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.4 — While currently below the lower Bollinger Band, the expectation of a rebound to $4,000 and consistent bullish momentum signals justify a moderately positive score.

SOL: +0.2 — Although lacking a buy signal, Solana's impressive growth narrative and potential for scalability provide a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintain a neutral stance on Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment and potential upward movement in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-31 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. dollar index is slightly lower, which could be supportive for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing mixed signals in the short term but have strong bullish long-term predictions, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $100K and Ethereum aiming for $4K. Solana's potential as a scalable platform is highlighted, although its technical indicators show no immediate buy signals. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, but Dogecoin's technicals suggest a cautious approach. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for growth in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed short-term technicals, the long-term outlook remains bullish with predictions of a significant price surge. On-chain activity is robust, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's potential rebound to $4K and strong on-chain activity support a positive outlook, though short-term technicals are mixed. A cautious increase in exposure is warranted.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana's long-term growth potential is noted, current technical indicators do not support an immediate buy. Maintain current exposure until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintain current exposure. The lack of strong directional cues suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the optimistic outlook for major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital towards more promising assets."
2024-08-31 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent dips, supported by predictions of a potential rally to $100K by the end of the year. Ethereum is also expected to recover, with analysts projecting a return to the $4,000 level. Solana continues to garner attention due to its significant growth and potential to rival major payment systems, although its technical indicators are currently mixed. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, but Dogecoin's recent price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest some positive sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed short-term technicals, the strong long-term prediction of a rally to $100K and high on-chain activity support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators show a possible breakdown, the news of a potential rebound to $4,000 provides a bullish long-term perspective.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and lack of immediate bullish momentum suggest a hold position, despite positive long-term growth potential.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum signal, combined with no negative news, support a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally optimistic market outlook and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end, as suggested by analysts. Ethereum is also expected to rebound to $4,000, despite recent skepticism. Solana continues to be highlighted for its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms like PayPal. However, the technical indicators for most assets, including BTC, ETH, and SOL, show a lack of immediate bullish momentum, suggesting a period of consolidation or sideways movement. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, supports a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, encouraging gradual capital allocation into riskier assets while maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT for risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the positive long-term outlook and potential for a year-end rally justify a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — The potential for a rebound to $4,000 and recent on-chain activity support a slight increase in exposure, though technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's growth narrative and scalability potential, along with steady on-chain activity, warrant a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential for upward movement in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-08-31 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is stable, and gold prices are high, which may suggest a cautious sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing potential for significant upside, with predictions of BTC reaching $100K and ETH returning to $4,000. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability, potentially positioning itself as a major player in the payment space. DOGE and USDT lack significant news, with DOGE showing some technical buy signals but lacking strong momentum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the prediction of a potential surge to $100K by year-end provides a positive outlook. The recent on-chain activity surge also supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are not currently bullish, the news of a potential rebound to $4,000 provides a positive sentiment. The slight price increase in the last hour suggests some recovery.

SOL: +0.2 — Although technical indicators are not strong, Solana's potential to rival payment giants like PayPal is a positive long-term signal. Current market activity remains stable.

DOGE: 0.0 — Technical buy signals are present, but without significant news or strong momentum, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish movements in BTC and ETH, there is an opportunity to rotate some capital out of stablecoins to capture potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-31 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with potential bullish trends emerging for major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing resilience despite recent dips, with predictions suggesting a potential rally toward $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound to $4,000, indicating a positive outlook. Solana continues to gain attention due to its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, suggesting strong growth prospects. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Tether remain stable, with no significant news impacting their current market positions. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable indices, supports a cautiously bullish stance, though the lack of strong technical buy signals suggests a need for careful allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the bullish news sentiment and potential for a year-end rally justify a moderately positive allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, the positive news sentiment about a potential rebound to $4,000 supports a slightly increased allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's strong growth narrative and potential to rival payment giants provide a positive outlook, warranting a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintaining a neutral position on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-08-31 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing potential for significant upside, with predictions of BTC reaching $100K and ETH returning to $4,000, which could drive investor interest. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability and growth potential, likened to major payment systems. Meanwhile, DOGE and USDT lack significant news, suggesting a stable outlook without major catalysts. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for growth in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the strong bullish news sentiment and potential for a significant rally provide a positive outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, Ethereum's potential rebound to $4,000 and stable technical indicators support a moderately positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's growth narrative and comparison to PayPal suggest long-term potential, though current technicals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, DOGE remains a hold with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.3 — In light of the positive sentiment for other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin is showing potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end, supported by strong on-chain activity and positive news sentiment. Ethereum, despite recent skepticism, is expected to rebound to $4,000, indicating a potential bullish outlook. Solana continues to be highlighted for its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment systems like PayPal. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, with DOGE showing some technical buy signals but low activity, and USDT maintaining its stability amidst a slightly bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news sentiment and potential for a significant rally, coupled with strong on-chain activity, suggest increasing exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential rebound to $4,000 and overall market optimism justify a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued positive sentiment and comparisons to major payment systems highlight its growth potential, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — With a slightly bullish market sentiment, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of riskier assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL is advisable."
2024-09-01 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index (VIX), indicating a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment in broader markets. However, the crypto market appears to be in a consolidation phase, with no significant price movements or news affecting the major cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL show a lack of strong bullish signals, while DOGE displays some buy signals but lacks momentum. USDT remains a safe haven with a consistent buy signal, reflecting its role as a stablecoin in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin shows no strong technical or on-chain signals to suggest a directional bias. The market is in a holding pattern, and without significant news, a neutral stance is appropriate.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is also experiencing low activity and lacks bullish momentum. With no significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators do not suggest a clear trend, and there are no news catalysts. The market data supports a neutral allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — While DOGE has a buy signal, the lack of momentum and significant news keeps the score modest. A slight positive bias is warranted due to technical signals.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT is sensible for stability and liquidity in a consolidating market."
2024-09-01 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. However, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a mild downturn, with most assets showing slight price decreases over the past few hours. Technical indicators for major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH are showing no clear buy signals, and momentum is generally lacking. SOL and DOGE have both dipped below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns, while USDT remains stable with a slight buy signal from its trend indicators. The absence of significant news across all assets suggests that market movements are primarily driven by technical factors and broader market sentiment rather than specific developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals earlier, BTC's price is declining, and there are no strong buy signals from trend indicators. The market sentiment is neutral, so maintaining current exposure is advisable.

ETH: -0.2 — ETH is showing signs of a potential breakdown, with prices dipping below the lower Bollinger Band and no bullish momentum. Reducing exposure slightly seems prudent given the lack of positive signals.

SOL: -0.3 — SOL has experienced a significant price decrease and is below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Reducing exposure is recommended to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.1 — DOGE is also below its lower Bollinger Band with no bullish momentum, suggesting caution. A slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is sensible to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-09-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing downward pressure, as indicated by their prices moving below the lower Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential breakdowns. Solana and Dogecoin also show signs of weakness, with their prices having recently dipped below the lower bands. Despite this, DOGE shows some potential with a buy signal from its short MA crossing above the long MA. USDT remains stable, with a consistent buy signal, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively low volatility index and stable dollar index, suggests a stable but cautious environment, potentially favoring stablecoins in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakdown with its price below the lower Bollinger Band and no significant bullish momentum, suggesting caution.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is also below its lower Bollinger Band with low on-chain activity, indicating potential further downside risk.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana has shown a slight recovery in price but lacks strong momentum or technical signals to justify a bullish position.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of strong momentum, DOGE's short MA is above the long MA, providing a mild buy signal amidst otherwise neutral conditions.

USDT: +0.5 — With the market showing signs of weakness, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital in a potentially bearish environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the technical indicators across multiple assets. BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE are all showing signs of potential breakdowns, with prices hovering around or below their respective lower Bollinger Bands and momentum indicators remaining below signal lines. There is no significant news to drive market sentiment for any of the assets, suggesting that the market is currently driven by technical factors and broader macroeconomic conditions. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a lack of strong directional catalysts, which may lead to a preference for holding stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is showing signs of a potential breakdown with low on-chain activity and no bullish technical signals. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — ETH is also exhibiting bearish technical signals with prices below the lower Bollinger Band and low on-chain activity. Reducing exposure due to lack of positive momentum.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL's price is slightly recovering but remains under bearish pressure. Reducing exposure slightly as the market lacks positive catalysts.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE shows no significant changes in data or sentiment. Maintaining current exposure as there is no clear directional signal.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall bearish sentiment and lack of positive momentum in other assets, increasing USDT holdings to preserve capital and reduce risk exposure."
2024-09-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets experiencing slight to significant price decreases over the past four hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD suggest a lack of bullish momentum, and several assets are trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. On-chain activity is mixed, with Bitcoin showing a recent surge in transactions, while Ethereum and Dogecoin display low activity. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a cautious market sentiment, potentially favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is experiencing a bearish trend with no significant bullish signals from technical indicators. The recent surge in transactions does not offset the overall negative sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also showing bearish signals with low on-chain activity and trading below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential further downside.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's price has seen a significant decrease, and technical indicators do not support a buy signal. However, normal on-chain activity prevents a stronger negative score.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin is trading below its lower Bollinger Band with no bullish momentum, indicating potential further declines, but normal on-chain activity suggests some stability.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce exposure to volatility."
2024-09-01 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish across the board for major cryptocurrencies, with all assets experiencing price declines over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD are not signaling any bullish momentum, and several assets are trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. On-chain activity remains mostly normal, with no significant news affecting the market. The macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility and stable interest rates, which might not provide strong directional cues for crypto assets. In such a bearish environment, holding stable assets like USDT might be preferable to mitigate risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is experiencing a consistent price decline, with technical indicators suggesting further downside risk. No significant news to counteract the bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's price is also declining, with no bullish technical signals or news to suggest a reversal. The market environment remains unfavorable.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has seen a significant price drop, and technical indicators do not support a buy. However, its on-chain activity remains stable, slightly mitigating the bearish outlook.

DOGE: -0.6 — Dogecoin is experiencing a significant price decline and low on-chain activity, indicating weak market interest and potential for further downside.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce risk exposure."
2024-09-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, suggesting a stable dollar, while gold prices are high, indicating a potential flight to safety. The S&P 500 is at a strong level, reflecting positive sentiment in traditional markets. However, the crypto market is experiencing a bearish sentiment with most assets showing a downward trend over the past hours. BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE are all trading below their respective lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. On-chain activity is mixed, with BTC showing a surge in transactions but not translating into positive price action. There is no significant news impacting the market, leaving technical and macroeconomic factors as primary drivers.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a surge in transactions, BTC is trading below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating a bearish trend. The lack of bullish technical signals suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.2 — ETH is also trading below its lower Bollinger Band with no bullish momentum signals. The absence of significant news and low on-chain activity further supports a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.1 — SOL has shown a significant price decrease and is below its lower Bollinger Band. However, normal on-chain activity suggests some resilience, warranting a slightly less negative score.

DOGE: -0.2 — DOGE is experiencing a breakdown with significant price decreases and low on-chain activity. The recent slight price increase does not offset the overall bearish trend.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish crypto market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce exposure to volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be slightly bearish, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing minor price declines over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD signals suggest a lack of bullish momentum across major assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. On-chain activity is generally normal, with occasional surges in transaction volumes, particularly for BTC and DOGE. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a cautious market environment. The absence of significant news for any of the assets indicates that the market is primarily driven by technical and macroeconomic factors rather than news events.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, BTC remains below key technical levels, and the absence of significant news or bullish signals suggests a neutral stance.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH shows no clear bullish signals, with technical indicators remaining neutral. The lack of significant news further supports a hold position.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL has experienced a significant price decrease recently, and technical indicators do not suggest a recovery. A slight reduction in exposure is warranted to manage risk.

DOGE: -0.3 — DOGE is below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Despite a recent transaction surge, the overall sentiment remains weak.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current cautious market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-09-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a general bearish sentiment across the major cryptocurrencies, with all assets experiencing slight to significant price decreases over the past four hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD suggest no bullish signals, while some assets like BTC and SOL are trading below their Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. On-chain activity remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting any of the cryptocurrencies. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar index, which may exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is showing signs of a potential breakdown with price trading below the lower Bollinger Band and no bullish technical signals. Given the current holding, a slight reduction is warranted.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH is trading within normal price bands with no significant technical or on-chain activity changes. Holding the current position is advisable.

SOL: -0.4 — SOL is experiencing a significant price decrease and is below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some activity surges, DOGE's technical indicators remain bearish, but no significant changes warrant an adjustment in position.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish environment, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk."
2024-09-01 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral risk sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto market, there is no significant news affecting the major assets, and technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE are showing no strong buy signals. On-chain activity for BTC and DOGE indicates some fluctuations, but overall, the market appears to be in a consolidation phase with no clear direction. USDT remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, with no significant changes in its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — BTC is showing normal on-chain activity and no strong technical signals. The lack of significant news and mixed price movements suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical or on-chain signals, and with no significant news, it is prudent to maintain a neutral position.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL has shown a slight downward price movement and is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential weakness. However, without significant news or strong bearish signals, only a slight reduction is warranted.

DOGE: -0.3 — DOGE has experienced an activity surge but remains within the Bollinger Bands with no strong buy signals. Given its current holdings, a slight reduction is advisable to manage risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets and given the stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against potential market volatility."

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment suggests a mixed sentiment with relatively stable conditions. The U.S. Dollar Index is moderately strong, and the S&P 500 is at a high level, indicating a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. However, the VIX is at a moderate level, suggesting some caution among investors. In the crypto market, all major cryptocurrencies are experiencing slight declines in price with no significant bullish signals from technical indicators or on-chain activity. The absence of significant news for any of the cryptocurrencies suggests a lack of immediate catalysts for price movement. Overall, the market appears to be in a consolidation phase, with no clear direction.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a recent price decline, on-chain activity remains robust. However, the lack of bullish technical signals and significant news keeps the outlook neutral.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical or news-driven catalysts. The market is stable, but without a clear direction, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL is trading below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential for further downside. With no positive news or technical signals, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE shows increased on-chain activity but lacks supportive technical indicators or news. The neutral stance reflects the absence of clear directional signals.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the lack of bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT is advisable to manage risk and preserve capital in uncertain conditions."
2024-09-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears neutral to slightly bearish, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing minor price declines over the past few hours. Technical indicators, such as moving averages and MACD, do not signal any strong bullish momentum across the major cryptocurrencies. On-chain activity remains within normal ranges, with no significant news events impacting the market sentiment. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, suggesting a cautious approach to risk assets. Given the lack of strong bullish signals and the absence of significant news, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a slight preference for stability seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin's price has been relatively stable with no significant news or technical signals to suggest a strong directional move. Maintaining current exposure is advisable.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum shows no strong buy or sell signals. The absence of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the recent price increase, Solana remains within a normal range. The slight positive price movement and normal on-chain activity warrant a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's recent activity surge does not translate into a clear buy or sell signal, and with no significant news, maintaining the current position is recommended.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies and the stable macroeconomic environment, a slight increase in USDT allocation provides a buffer against potential volatility."
2024-09-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a lack of significant bullish or bearish signals across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets showing no strong trend or momentum signals. The macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX and a stable U.S. Dollar Index. The absence of significant news across all assets further emphasizes the neutral sentiment. Given the lack of strong directional cues, a cautious approach is warranted, with a focus on maintaining balance and readiness for potential shifts in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin's technical indicators and on-chain activity remain neutral, with no significant news to drive direction. Maintaining current exposure is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum shows no clear directional signals or news impacts, suggesting a hold position is appropriate.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of strong buy signals, Solana's recent price increase and consistent on-chain activity suggest a slight preference for increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's increased transaction activity is notable, but without supporting bullish signals or news, maintaining current holdings is advisable.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the overall neutral market sentiment, a slight increase in stablecoin allocation can provide a buffer against potential volatility, while still allowing for flexibility in future reallocation."
2024-09-01 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a lack of significant bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, with technical indicators showing no clear buy signals and momentum indicators remaining below their respective signal lines. Despite minor fluctuations in price, there is no substantial news to drive market sentiment in either direction. The macroeconomic context, including stable interest rates and a moderate U.S. dollar index, suggests a neutral to slightly cautious market stance. The S&P 500 and gold prices are stable, and the VIX is relatively low, indicating a calm broader market environment. In such conditions, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight preference for stability and liquidity seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin's technical indicators and on-chain activity do not show strong bullish or bearish signals. The absence of significant news keeps the sentiment neutral.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum's technicals are neutral, with no significant news to influence sentiment. The slight price fluctuations do not warrant a change in allocation.

SOL: +0.1 — Solana experienced a slight increase in price and volume, which could indicate a mild positive sentiment. However, without strong technical or news-driven signals, the score remains modest.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some activity surges, Dogecoin's overall market signals remain neutral with no significant news to drive a directional change.

USDT: +0.2 — In the absence of strong bullish signals for other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides liquidity and stability in a neutral market environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears neutral to slightly bearish, with no significant news driving any of the major cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE show a lack of bullish momentum, as evidenced by the short-term moving averages being below the long-term ones and the MACD signals being below their respective signal lines. On-chain activity is generally normal, with occasional surges, but nothing indicating a strong directional move. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a lack of external catalysts for significant price movements in the crypto market. In such an environment, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a slight preference for stability seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin shows no strong directional signals, with mixed on-chain activity and no significant news. Holding the current position seems appropriate.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are neutral, and there is no news to drive a change in sentiment. Maintaining the current allocation is advisable.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the lack of bullish technical signals, SOL has shown some positive price movements and volume spikes, suggesting a slight upward potential.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin has experienced a slight price decrease and increased on-chain activity, but without strong technical support or news, a minor reduction in exposure is warranted.

USDT: +0.2 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."
2024-09-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals, with slight fluctuations in prices across major cryptocurrencies. Despite the absence of significant news, on-chain activity shows some surges, particularly in Bitcoin and Dogecoin, although these are not accompanied by strong technical buy signals. The macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment, with moderate volatility and no drastic changes in key indicators like the U.S. Dollar Index or S&P 500. Overall, the market sentiment appears neutral to slightly cautious, with no clear bullish or bearish trends dominating.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite increased on-chain activity, technical indicators do not support a strong buy signal. The market remains stable without significant news to drive momentum.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum shows normal activity levels and slight price increases, but lacks strong technical or news-driven catalysts to justify a change in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana has shown a significant price increase and bullish momentum in the last hour, making it relatively more attractive compared to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin exhibits increased on-chain activity but lacks supporting technical signals or news to drive a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential volatility, reflecting a cautious approach."
2024-09-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which can be supportive for cryptocurrencies as a weaker dollar often leads to increased interest in alternative assets. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies shows a lack of strong bullish signals, with most assets trading within normal ranges and no significant news impacting sentiment. The technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and DOGE show no clear buy signals, while SOL shows some bullish momentum. Overall, the market sentiment appears neutral to slightly cautious, with no strong drivers for a significant upward or downward move in the immediate term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin's price is relatively stable with no significant news or technical indicators suggesting a strong move in either direction. The lack of bullish signals and normal on-chain activity suggest a hold position.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is experiencing normal price fluctuations and on-chain activity, with no significant news or technical indicators to drive a strong allocation change. Maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana shows some bullish momentum with a positive MACD signal, suggesting potential for upward movement. The slight increase in price and volume supports a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's technical indicators and on-chain activity do not suggest any significant changes. With no news or strong signals, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals across other assets and the stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential volatility, allowing for flexibility in future allocations."
2024-09-01 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context presents a mixed environment for risk assets, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting some risk appetite, but the absence of significant news across major cryptocurrencies indicates a lack of strong directional drivers. In the crypto market, technical indicators are generally neutral to slightly bearish, with most assets trading within normal Bollinger Bands and lacking strong momentum signals. On-chain activity shows some surges, particularly in Ethereum and Bitcoin, but these are not accompanied by bullish technical signals. The overall sentiment appears cautious, with no clear bullish or bearish trend dominating.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.1 — Despite the lack of strong bullish signals, Bitcoin's recent surge in on-chain activity suggests potential for upward movement. However, caution is warranted due to the absence of supportive news or strong technical indicators.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum shows consistent on-chain activity surges, which may indicate underlying interest. The recent bullish momentum signal provides a slight positive bias, although the lack of news keeps the outlook moderate.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's bullish momentum and significant price increase in recent hours suggest a more favorable outlook compared to other assets. The lack of news is neutral, but technicals are slightly supportive.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's technical indicators remain neutral to slightly bearish, with no significant news to drive sentiment. Given current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: 0.0 — With no strong directional signals in the market, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is advisable to preserve flexibility for future allocation adjustments."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture, with relatively stable interest rates and a subdued volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk environment. The cryptocurrency market data over the past few hours indicates a general increase in prices for major assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, with SOL showing consistent bullish momentum. However, technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD signals are not strongly supportive of a bullish trend, suggesting caution. On-chain activity remains within normal ranges, with no significant news events impacting sentiment. The lack of significant news across all assets implies that market movements are primarily driven by technical and macroeconomic factors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a slight increase in price and some bullish momentum, the lack of a strong trend signal suggests a cautious approach. However, BTC remains a core asset with potential for upside.

ETH: +0.2 — ETH shows some bullish momentum and price increases, but technical indicators are not yet fully supportive. Maintain a moderate positive stance due to its strong market position.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and significant price increases make SOL relatively attractive. The asset shows potential for continued upside, warranting a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE has seen a price increase, the absence of bullish technical signals and significant news suggests a hold position is appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive sentiment in the market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-09-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum, particularly in the last hour. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced slight increases in price, supported by bullish momentum signals, although they remain below their long-term moving averages. Solana has shown a notable upward trend with both trend and momentum signals aligning positively, indicating a potential buy opportunity. Dogecoin, despite slight price increases, lacks strong technical support for a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant news affecting the crypto market. The U.S. dollar index is stable, and the S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of a strong trend signal, the bullish momentum and stable macroeconomic environment suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Similar to BTC, Ethereum shows bullish momentum, but the absence of significant news or strong trend signals warrants a modest increase.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong buy signal supported by positive trend and momentum indicators, making it the most attractive asset currently.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is a slight price increase, the lack of supporting technical signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite slightly increases, reducing exposure to stablecoins in favor of assets with bullish momentum is advisable."
2024-09-01 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish momentum in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, as indicated by their MACD signals being above the signal line. However, the absence of significant news and the lack of strong buy signals from trend indicators suggest a cautious approach. SOL stands out with a positive trend signal and consistent bullish momentum, indicating potential for short-term gains. DOGE shows some bullish momentum but lacks strong technical support. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk appetite, but the absence of significant news leaves the market direction uncertain. USDT remains a stable option, but with some capital rotation into riskier assets, its attractiveness may decrease slightly.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bullish momentum is present, but the absence of a strong trend signal and significant news keeps the score moderate. 

ETH: +0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows bullish momentum, but the lack of news and a strong trend signal suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive trend and momentum signals, combined with consistent volume, make SOL relatively more attractive for short-term allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, the lack of a strong trend signal and significant news keeps DOGE neutral.

USDT: -0.2 — With some capital rotation into riskier assets, USDT's relative attractiveness decreases slightly, though it remains a stable option."
2024-09-01 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower at 101.7, which may support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. In the past four hours, most cryptocurrencies have shown mixed signals with some bullish momentum, particularly in Ethereum and Solana, which have both exhibited buy signals in their short-term moving averages. Bitcoin, while maintaining bullish momentum, lacks a clear buy signal from its moving averages. Dogecoin shows some bullish momentum but lacks strong buy signals, and USDT remains stable as expected for a stablecoin. No significant news has been reported for any of the assets, suggesting market movements are primarily driven by technical factors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin shows consistent bullish momentum, but without a clear buy signal from moving averages. The lack of significant news keeps the score moderate.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum has a buy signal from its moving averages and bullish momentum, suggesting a favorable short-term outlook despite the absence of news.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana has both a buy signal and bullish momentum, making it relatively more attractive than other assets in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, Dogecoin lacks strong buy signals and significant news, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With some bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, as evidenced by significant price decreases across major cryptocurrencies in the last hour. BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE have all experienced notable declines, with prices falling below their respective lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests that external factors are not currently driving significant risk appetite. The lack of significant news across all assets further emphasizes the market's focus on technical and on-chain data. In this environment, a cautious approach is warranted, with a potential shift towards safer assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent significant price drop and breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band suggest caution. Lack of bullish signals in both trend and momentum indicators.

ETH: -0.3 — Similar to BTC, ETH has experienced a significant price decrease and breakdown, with no supporting news or bullish technical indicators.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the price drop, SOL maintains a buy signal in trend and momentum indicators, suggesting some resilience compared to other assets.

DOGE: -0.4 — Significant price decrease and breakdown, with no positive momentum or trend signals to counteract the bearish sentiment.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, USDT offers stability and safety, making it an attractive option for capital preservation."
2024-09-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Recent data indicates significant price drops across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, with all experiencing a breakdown below their lower Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential further downside or consolidation. Despite this, some assets like SOL still exhibit bullish momentum signals, indicating potential resilience. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a stable but cautious broader financial environment. The absence of significant news for any of the assets implies that current market movements are primarily driven by technical and on-chain data rather than external news catalysts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC shows bearish technical signals with a breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band and no buy signals from trend indicators. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH has mixed signals with a recent price recovery but remains below the lower Bollinger Band. Neutral stance as it may stabilize or continue downward.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop, SOL maintains a buy signal from trend indicators and bullish momentum, suggesting potential for recovery.

DOGE: -0.2 — DOGE's technical indicators are bearish, with a breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band and no buy signals. A slight reduction in exposure is recommended.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a safe haven is advisable, supporting portfolio stability."
2024-09-02 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, over the past few hours. Despite a slight recovery in the most recent hour, the market remains under pressure, with BTC and ETH experiencing notable outflows and technical indicators suggesting potential breakdowns. The macroeconomic context, including a stable U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, does not provide strong directional cues, although upcoming U.S. economic data could influence market dynamics. Notably, DOGE has been among the top decliners, while USDT remains stable, reflecting a potential flight to safety amid uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support from weaker dollar expectations could provide a near-term boost. Maintain a cautious positive stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with potential SEC challenges and recent price breakdowns. Hold position as technicals and sentiment are unclear.

SOL: +0.3 — Although recent price declines are concerning, the consistent buy signal from trend indicators suggests some underlying strength. Moderate positive allocation is warranted.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant price declines and bearish sentiment warrant reducing exposure, especially given current holdings. The lack of positive catalysts further supports a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safety net and liquidity for potential future opportunities."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and DOGE. Bitcoin's price has been hovering around $58.5K, with significant outflows from U.S. ETFs, indicating a potential lack of confidence among institutional investors. However, upcoming U.S. economic data could weaken the dollar, which might provide some support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC regarding its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan, adding uncertainty to its outlook. Solana shows some technical strength with buy signals, but lacks significant news to drive sentiment. Dogecoin has been among the top decliners, reflecting broader bearish market sentiment. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic developments could support Bitcoin. Maintain a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX's bankruptcy plan creates a cloud over Ethereum, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and lack of negative news make Solana relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant recent declines and lack of positive catalysts suggest reducing exposure to Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a hedge against volatility is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing seasonal bearishness, although there is potential for support from upcoming U.S. macroeconomic data that could weaken the dollar. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC concerning FTX's bankruptcy, which could impact its distribution and market perception. Solana has no significant news, while Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment. Tether remains stable without significant news, but its technical indicators suggest a potential breakdown, indicating a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the seasonal bearishness, potential support from macroeconomic factors and the possibility of a weaker dollar could provide upward momentum. Maintain a cautious but slightly positive stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX's bankruptcy plan create uncertainty, offsetting any potential bullish sentiment. Hold position until clarity emerges.

SOL: +0.2 — No significant news, but stable on-chain activity and a slight price increase suggest moderate potential. Maintain a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent declines and bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure. The lack of positive catalysts further supports a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent to manage risk effectively."
2024-09-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bearish as we enter September, with Bitcoin showing slight gains but facing seasonal headwinds and ETF outflows. The macroeconomic context, including potential weakness in the U.S. dollar, might provide some support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts, which could weigh on sentiment. Dogecoin is experiencing a notable decline, reflecting broader market bearishness. Solana and Tether lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators show no immediate bullish signals, while Tether remains a safe haven amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite seasonal bearishness, potential macroeconomic support and active on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.2 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, maintaining current exposure seems prudent.

DOGE: -0.5 — With DOGE among the top decliners and no positive catalysts, reducing exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment and regulatory concerns, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven is recommended."
2024-09-02 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bearish, with Bitcoin starting September on a slightly negative note amid ETF outflows and seasonal trends. Macroeconomic factors, such as potential U.S. dollar weakening, may offer some support to Bitcoin, although this is not yet evident in the technical indicators. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges with the SEC possibly blocking FTX creditor payouts in ETH, adding uncertainty to its outlook. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting broader market bearishness. Solana and USDT have no significant news, but USDT's technicals suggest a potential breakdown, indicating a cautious approach to stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the current bearish sentiment and technical indicators, potential macroeconomic support from a weakening dollar could provide a modest upside. Maintain a slight positive bias.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC add uncertainty, and technical indicators show no bullish signals. Slightly reduce exposure due to these risks.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, maintain current exposure. No compelling reason to adjust allocation at this time.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant recent price decline and bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.1 — While technicals indicate a potential breakdown, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given the broader market's cautious sentiment. Slightly increase allocation to hedge against volatility in other assets."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- *Bitcoin starts September at ~$58.5K amid seasonally bearish market*
   Trading hovered around $58,600 with a slight uptick (~1%), but U.S. ETFs saw $175M in outflows, extending a four-day losing streak.
- *Key macro week ahead could buoy BTC*
   Anticipated U.S. manufacturing and jobs data may weaken the dollar, potentially providing support for bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- *SEC may block FTX creditor payouts in ETH*
   The SEC has signaled it could challenge any use of Ethereum in creditor distributions under FTX's bankruptcy plan.

**Solana (SOL)**

- No significant news found for SOL on that day.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- *DOGE among top decliners*
   Dogecoin dropped ~3–5%, lagging behind bitcoin as market sentiment turned bearish at September’s outset.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day.

### 4. Current Portfolio Status
- BTC: 0.7655

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight uptick despite ETF outflows, and potential macroeconomic developments might provide support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could weigh on its price. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news impact, although Dogecoin has been a recent underperformer. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a stable dollar and low volatility, suggests a neutral to slightly bearish environment, favoring a more conservative approach with a higher allocation to stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support and slight price upticks suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts creates a neutral stance despite stable price action.

SOL: +0.1 — No significant news or technical signals, but moderate price recovery suggests a slight positive bias.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent underperformance and lack of positive catalysts warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market sentiment and mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for stability."
2024-09-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite a seasonally bearish start to September. The potential for macroeconomic data to weaken the U.S. dollar could provide additional support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan, which may weigh on sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have shown mixed performance, with Dogecoin notably declining amid bearish sentiment. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid these mixed signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the seasonally bearish trend, Bitcoin's potential support from macroeconomic factors and its resilience in price suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding Ethereum's use in FTX's bankruptcy plan create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — No significant news, but the recent price recovery and consistent on-chain activity suggest a slight positive bias.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment indicate a need to reduce exposure slightly, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish signals for Bitcoin and a stable market environment, some capital rotation out of USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-09-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously bearish, with slight declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing seasonal bearishness, though potential macroeconomic developments could provide support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's potential intervention in FTX-related matters, which could impact its price. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting negative sentiment. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the bearish sentiment, potential macroeconomic support and increased on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal, especially with the possibility of a weaker dollar.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts create uncertainty, balancing out any potential bullish sentiment from technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, SOL remains neutral. The lack of a clear catalyst suggests holding the current position.

DOGE: -0.3 — As one of the top decliners and with low on-chain activity, reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk."
2024-09-02 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of upward momentum despite a seasonally bearish start to September. The potential weakening of the U.S. dollar due to upcoming macroeconomic data could further support Bitcoin. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges, which may impact its short-term attractiveness. Solana and Dogecoin have shown significant price increases recently, but Dogecoin's broader sentiment remains bearish. USDT remains stable, with no significant developments affecting its status as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin exhibits bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainties and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent price increases and positive momentum warrant a moderate buy signal, despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite recent price gains, overall sentiment remains bearish, justifying a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and potential capital rotation into other assets, a slight decrease in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-09-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum in both price and on-chain activity. Bitcoin, in particular, is experiencing a slight uptick despite recent ETF outflows, and upcoming macroeconomic data could further support its price. Ethereum is facing potential regulatory challenges from the SEC regarding its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which could weigh on sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin facing bearish sentiment as one of the top decliners. USDT remains stable, but the overall market trend suggests a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic tailwinds make it an attractive asset, despite ETF outflows. The market's anticipation of a weaker dollar could further support BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Although facing regulatory uncertainty, Ethereum's technical indicators show bullish momentum, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a lack of significant news, Solana's price and volume increases suggest a moderate opportunity for gains.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's recent decline and bearish sentiment make it less attractive, though no major sell-off is warranted given current holdings.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of increased risk appetite, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-09-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of upward momentum despite recent ETF outflows. The macroeconomic context suggests potential support for Bitcoin if upcoming U.S. economic data weakens the dollar. Ethereum faces uncertainty due to potential SEC intervention in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which could impact its use in creditor payouts. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive momentum in recent hours, but Dogecoin's recent decline highlights its vulnerability to bearish sentiment. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support make it attractive, despite ETF outflows. The market is showing resilience with a positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum, the uncertainty around SEC actions regarding FTX's bankruptcy plan introduces risk, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's positive momentum and stable on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal, although the absence of significant news limits stronger conviction.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite recent momentum, Dogecoin's decline and bearish sentiment at the start of September suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive momentum in other assets and potential for increased risk appetite, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-09-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — While Bitcoin faces ETF outflows, the potential for a weaker dollar and bullish momentum signals suggest moderate upside potential.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX payouts create uncertainty, offsetting the bullish momentum signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity warrant a modest positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent underperformance and bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure, though the existing holding limits the score to a mild negative.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish opportunities in BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential support from macroeconomic factors, such as anticipated U.S. data that could weaken the dollar. Despite this, Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows, indicating some investor caution. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty with the SEC potentially challenging its use in FTX creditor distributions, which could weigh on sentiment. Solana lacks significant news but maintains a bullish momentum signal, while Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, with bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support. However, ETF outflows suggest some caution, warranting a moderate positive score.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical signals, regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX's use of Ethereum create uncertainty, justifying a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana shows bullish momentum and a recent buy signal, though lacking significant news, it remains a relatively attractive option in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin is facing bearish sentiment and is among the top decliners, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential for increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is recommended to capitalize on market opportunities."
2024-09-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite seasonal bearish trends. The potential for weakening U.S. dollar due to upcoming macroeconomic data could provide additional support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty with the SEC potentially challenging its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan, which could weigh on sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have shown recent price increases, with Solana experiencing a significant uptick in the last hour. Dogecoin, however, has been among the top decliners recently, reflecting mixed sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin maintains bullish momentum and could benefit from potential dollar weakness, making it relatively attractive.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts in Ethereum creates mixed sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook, though lacking significant news to drive a stronger signal.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent declines and bearish sentiment at the start of September suggest caution, though the latest price increase tempers the need for significant reduction.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish trends in other assets and no significant news, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent as risk appetite increases."
2024-09-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent ETF outflows and a seasonally bearish start to September. Anticipated macroeconomic data could potentially weaken the U.S. dollar, which may provide support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could impact its short-term attractiveness. Solana and Dogecoin show mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin experiencing a decline amid bearish sentiment. Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and potential macroeconomic developments could support its price. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns regarding the SEC's stance on Ethereum in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance despite strong technical indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive technical signals and a lack of negative news suggest a modestly bullish outlook, although the absence of significant news limits confidence.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment make Dogecoin less attractive, prompting a reduction in exposure while still holding due to current portfolio status.

USDT: -0.2 — While maintaining some exposure for stability, a slight reduction is warranted as the market shows signs of cautious optimism, potentially favoring riskier assets."
2024-09-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators, such as positive momentum and trend signals. Bitcoin is slightly up, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the dollar, providing a tailwind for BTC. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing positive price movements, although Dogecoin's recent decline suggests mixed sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no significant news or technical signals indicating a shift in its role as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite ETF outflows.

ETH: 0.0 — While technicals are positive, regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts introduces potential downside risk.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish technical signals and significant price increases indicate strong momentum, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite recent price increases, Dogecoin's status as a top decliner and mixed sentiment suggest caution is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential support from macroeconomic factors such as anticipated weaker U.S. dollar data. Despite a seasonally bearish start to September, Bitcoin maintains a slight upward momentum. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings. Solana and Dogecoin show mixed signals, with Dogecoin experiencing a notable decline in sentiment. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a potential safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support, despite ETF outflows. This makes it relatively attractive in the current environment.

ETH: -0.1 — While Ethereum's technicals are positive, the potential SEC challenge introduces uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana maintains strong technical signals with no negative news, suggesting it remains a favorable choice for capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's recent decline and lack of positive catalysts suggest reducing exposure, especially given its underperformance relative to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of cautious optimism, there is an opportunity to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more promising assets."
2024-09-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite seasonal bearish tendencies and potential macroeconomic support from weakening dollar expectations. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could weigh on its performance. Solana and Dogecoin have shown mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin experiencing a recent decline. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, though the S&P 500's high level indicates potential for volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain strong, and potential macroeconomic support could provide a tailwind.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts in ETH creates a neutral outlook despite positive technical indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, though lacking significant news, suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price decline and low on-chain activity warrant a slight reduction in exposure, though current holdings are minimal.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish sentiment in the crypto market, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to allocate more towards risk assets."
2024-09-02 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing slight upward movement, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the dollar, thus benefiting BTC. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact its use in certain financial transactions. Solana and Dogecoin have shown significant price increases, though Dogecoin's recent decline highlights mixed sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support, despite ETF outflows. The overall sentiment is cautiously bullish.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum is experiencing bullish momentum, the potential SEC challenge introduces some uncertainty, warranting a more cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's significant price increase and consistent bullish signals make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, Dogecoin's mixed sentiment and previous decline suggest a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals across other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of USDT into more promising opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators, such as short-term moving averages above long-term ones and MACD signals indicating upward momentum. Bitcoin, in particular, is benefiting from potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the U.S. dollar, providing a supportive environment. However, there are some bearish signals, such as ETF outflows and seasonal trends, that could temper enthusiasm. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could affect its attractiveness. Dogecoin has been among the top decliners, reflecting weaker market sentiment. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst these mixed signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators and potential macroeconomic tailwinds suggest a favorable environment for growth. The anticipated weakening of the dollar could further support BTC.

ETH: 0.0 — While Ethereum shows bullish technical signals, the potential SEC challenge introduces significant uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance until more clarity emerges.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's consistent bullish momentum and lack of negative news make it an attractive option for capital allocation, especially given its recent price increases.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's recent decline and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure, especially as it lags behind other major cryptocurrencies in sentiment and performance.

USDT: -0.2 — While maintaining some exposure to USDT for stability, the overall bullish sentiment across other assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-02 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies demonstrating bullish technical indicators, such as short-term moving averages above long-term ones and positive MACD signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by macroeconomic factors that could weaken the dollar, thus providing a tailwind for BTC. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions against FTX's bankruptcy plan, which may impact its price stability. Solana and Dogecoin show positive momentum, although Dogecoin has been identified as a laggard in recent market movements. USDT remains stable, with no significant bullish signals, indicating a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The possible weakening of the dollar could further boost BTC's attractiveness.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and technical signals, though the news of potential SEC actions warrants a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and no negative news suggest a continued positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, recent news highlights its underperformance relative to other assets, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capture potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-09-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential support due to macroeconomic factors that could weaken the U.S. dollar, despite recent ETF outflows. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty with the SEC's potential challenge to its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan, which could dampen investor sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin facing bearish sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a slightly weaker dollar, suggests a potential shift towards riskier assets, although the market remains vigilant.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support suggest a moderate buy signal. The anticipated weakening of the dollar could provide additional tailwinds.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan creates a neutral stance. While technical indicators remain positive, the news adds a layer of caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and stable on-chain activity, despite the absence of significant news, support a modest buy signal.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent bearish sentiment and lack of significant positive developments suggest a cautious approach, with a slight reduction in exposure warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — As market conditions hint at a potential shift towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of other cryptocurrencies seems prudent."
2024-09-03 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies, despite recent macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and stock market weakness. Bitcoin shows strong institutional interest, particularly in the context of potential ETF inflows, which supports a long-term bullish outlook. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for a breakout, although it remains under technical pressure. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience with significant price appreciation despite large outflows, and its decentralization narrative remains intact. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed, with legal issues resolved but community interest shifting towards new opportunities. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook, despite recent price volatility linked to macroeconomic factors.

ETH: +0.5 — Accumulation by whales and potential for a technical breakout provide a positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to current price pressures.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued resilience and positive sentiment around decentralization support a bullish stance, even with recent large holder liquidations.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest a neutral stance, with community interest shifting elsewhere.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is expected, but it remains a necessary hedge in the portfolio."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, supported by technical indicators and on-chain activity. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by institutional interest in BTC ETFs, despite recent market slumps linked to broader economic concerns. Ethereum is showing potential for a breakout, with significant whale accumulation and technical patterns suggesting a possible upward move. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and growth despite large outflows, while Dogecoin's recent legal victory and community interest in new ICOs provide a mixed sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven in volatile markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and bullish institutional outlooks suggest a favorable environment for BTC, despite recent price dips.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive accumulation by whales and potential breakout from a wedge pattern indicate a promising outlook, though not as strong as BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued positive performance and resilience despite outflows, along with strong technical indicators, support a moderately bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal clarity and community interest in new projects provide some positive sentiment, though overall market conditions remain cautious.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals across other assets, there's a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-09-03 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a bullish undertone, driven by positive technical indicators and institutional interest, particularly in Bitcoin. Despite a recent dip linked to broader market concerns, Bitcoin's long-term outlook remains supported by potential ETF inflows. Ethereum shows signs of potential breakout patterns, with whale accumulation suggesting confidence at current levels. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and growth despite large outflows, while Dogecoin faces mixed sentiment amid legal news and community interest in new opportunities. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced risk approach, though caution is warranted given the broader market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and institutional interest in ETFs suggest a positive outlook, despite recent price volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and potential breakout patterns provide a cautiously optimistic view, though recent sell pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite outflows, Solana's strong performance and decentralization efforts support a positive allocation, with technical indicators remaining bullish.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal news and community actions provide no clear directional signal, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure aligns with increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-09-03 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum in technical indicators, despite recent volatility and macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin's price has been fluctuating, influenced by broader market dips and inflation concerns, but institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a positive long-term factor. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential upside, although it faces technical resistance. Solana continues to perform well despite large outflows, supported by strong decentralization narratives. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed, with legal issues resolved but community interest shifting towards new opportunities. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for recovery. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout provide a positive outlook, though resistance remains. Slightly increase exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance and positive sentiment around decentralization support a higher allocation. Increase exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with no clear directional bias. Hold current position.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, reduce stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital into riskier assets."
2024-09-03 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with positive momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies despite recent price declines. Bitcoin has shown resilience amidst broader market slumps, supported by institutional interest in BTC ETFs. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for a breakout. Solana continues to perform well despite significant outflows, suggesting underlying strength. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed, with legal news providing some relief, but community interest shifting towards new opportunities. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, suggests a balanced risk environment, encouraging selective risk-taking over holding stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, BTC's strong on-chain activity and institutional interest in ETFs provide a supportive backdrop for potential gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and technical patterns suggest possible upward movement, although current price levels are still below key resistance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's robust performance and defense of decentralization, coupled with strong technical signals, make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal relief balanced by community interest in alternative investments; no strong directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive momentum in other cryptocurrencies and a stable macro environment, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of USDT into riskier assets."
2024-09-03 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and weakness in U.S. stocks, which have impacted Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Despite this, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains robust, particularly with the potential for significant inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential bullish momentum, though technical indicators show mixed signals. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and growth despite large outflows, supported by its decentralized network narrative. Dogecoin's sentiment remains bearish, but recent legal victories and community interest in new projects could provide support. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, institutional interest and bullish ETF projections provide a positive outlook. On-chain activity also shows potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout suggest a cautiously optimistic stance, though recent sell pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance and resilience in the face of outflows, coupled with positive decentralization news, make SOL attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal news providing some support, but overall bearish market conditions and community interest in alternatives suggest a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish signals in other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-09-03 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has experienced a dip below $58k, influenced by broader market conditions, yet institutional interest remains strong with potential ETF inflows. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical perspective, although it faces seller pressure. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience with strong performance despite significant outflows, supported by a decentralized network narrative. Dogecoin sentiment is mixed, with legal news providing some relief, but community interest is shifting towards new opportunities. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and bullish ETF projections provide a positive outlook. On-chain activity also supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Potential technical breakout and whale accumulation suggest a cautious buy, though seller pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance and decentralization narrative, coupled with bullish technical signals, make SOL an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal relief but no strong bullish catalysts. Community interest in new ICOs suggests a wait-and-see approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish opportunities in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-09-03 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price volatility, institutional interest and strong on-chain activity provide a bullish outlook. The potential for ETF inflows supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and technical indicators suggest a potential breakout. However, current price levels and seller pressure warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong historical performance and resilience against large outflows make SOL attractive. Positive sentiment from the community and technical strength support a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with recent legal news and community activity around a new ICO. No strong directional signal justifies a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish trends in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on riskier opportunities."
2024-09-03 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a slight dip, influenced by broader market conditions such as rising inflation and weakness in U.S. stocks, yet the long-term outlook remains positive due to potential institutional inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is showing signs of accumulation by large holders, despite technical pressures, suggesting potential for a breakout. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience with strong performance despite significant outflows, and Dogecoin's legal troubles have eased, though sentiment remains bearish. The macroeconomic context, including stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, with no significant news impacting Tether.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, the long-term institutional interest in BTC ETFs supports a cautiously positive outlook. The buy signals from trend indicators also provide some confidence.

ETH: +0.1 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout signals a slight positive bias, though current price levels remain pressured by seller activity.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong historical performance and positive sentiment from decentralization efforts and community support suggest a favorable outlook, despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: 0.0 — While legal issues have been resolved, the community's focus on new ICOs indicates mixed sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — In a cautiously optimistic market environment, some capital rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets is expected, reducing the need for USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite a recent dip linked to broader market weakness and inflation concerns. Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs remains strong, suggesting potential long-term inflows. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating confidence in its potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern. Solana continues to perform well, maintaining its decentralized narrative despite large outflows. Dogecoin's legal troubles have eased, but sentiment remains bearish as the community looks for new opportunities. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent price fluctuations, institutional interest and a bullish ETF outlook provide a strong foundation for potential gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and technical patterns suggest a possible breakout, though current price levels remain challenging.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued positive performance and strong decentralization narrative support further capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal clarity provides some relief, but overall sentiment remains mixed with no strong directional cues.

USDT: -0.4 — With growing interest in riskier assets, there's a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-03 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bearish pressure due to macroeconomic concerns such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks, which have impacted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite this, there is a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly with potential inflows from spot BTC ETFs. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting confidence at current levels, though technicals indicate potential volatility. Solana has shown resilience despite significant outflows, supported by its decentralized network narrative. Dogecoin is experiencing some community-driven interest despite recent bearish sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.4 — Despite short-term bearish pressure, the long-term bullish outlook from institutional interest in BTC ETFs supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout provide a slightly positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to current market conditions.

SOL: +0.5 — Resilience in the face of outflows and a strong narrative on decentralization suggest a favorable position relative to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with no clear directional signal; community interest is offset by broader bearish sentiment.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent, but a slight reduction is warranted to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."
2024-09-03 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent dips linked to broader market weaknesses and inflation concerns. Institutional interest remains strong, particularly with potential inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting confidence in its long-term prospects, though technical indicators suggest potential volatility. Solana continues to demonstrate strength, outperforming despite significant liquidations, and maintains a narrative of decentralization. Dogecoin has experienced a slight boost in sentiment following the dismissal of a manipulation lawsuit, although it remains under pressure. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, institutional interest and ETF inflow potential provide a bullish outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout suggest a cautious buy, though mixed technicals temper enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.4 — Strong performance and positive sentiment around decentralization support a favorable allocation, despite recent outflows.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent legal news provides a slight sentiment boost, but overall market conditions and bearish sentiment keep the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With a moderate risk appetite and potential capital rotation into other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable."
2024-09-03 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with recent declines across major cryptocurrencies, influenced by broader market dips and inflation concerns. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, driven by a slump in the crypto market and U.S. stock weakness, although institutional interest remains strong with potential ETF inflows. Ethereum is witnessing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for a rebound, despite being under technical pressure. Solana continues to show resilience despite large outflows, supported by strong decentralization claims. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment but has seen some legal clarity with the dismissal of a manipulation lawsuit. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, institutional interest in BTC ETFs provides a long-term bullish outlook, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: +0.1 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout suggest a cautious positive stance, though recent sell pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong performance despite outflows and positive decentralization news support a favorable allocation, indicating resilience and potential upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal clarity offset by bearish community sentiment; no strong directional signal at present.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market uncertainty and recent declines in major cryptos, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, influenced by a broader market dip linked to weakness in U.S. stocks and rising inflation pressures. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price drop, falling below $58k, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains positive. Ethereum is facing technical pressure at the lower band of a wedge pattern, with large holders accumulating. Solana has shown resilience despite large outflows, supported by its decentralized network. Dogecoin has faced legal challenges but remains under bearish sentiment, with community interest in new ICOs. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price breakdown and bearish macroeconomic context suggest caution, despite long-term bullish ETF outlook. Current holdings should be reduced slightly.

ETH: +0.1 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout provide a slight positive bias, but overall sentiment remains cautious.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, Solana's strong network fundamentals and past performance warrant a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Legal dismissal provides slight relief, but overall bearish sentiment and price breakdown suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-09-03 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by a broader market dip linked to weakness in U.S. stocks and rising inflation pressures. Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, dragging other cryptocurrencies down with it. Despite this, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with potential long-term inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is facing technical pressure but shows potential for a breakout, while Solana continues to demonstrate resilience despite large outflows. Dogecoin is experiencing bearish sentiment, although community interest remains. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are likely to see increased demand as investors seek safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, the current bearish market sentiment and recent price decline suggest caution. Holding a reduced position is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — While technicals indicate potential for a breakout, the current bearish trend and mixed news suggest maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the bearish market, Solana's resilience and positive news about decentralization support a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Bearish sentiment and recent price declines warrant a cautious approach, though the dismissal of the lawsuit is a positive development.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-09-03 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. This downturn is largely influenced by macroeconomic factors, including rising inflation pressures and a dip in U.S. stock markets. Despite this, there are some long-term bullish signals, particularly for BTC, with institutional interest in BTC ETFs remaining strong. ETH is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential support levels. Meanwhile, DOGE has experienced legal news that could stabilize its price, though community sentiment remains cautious. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price decline, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests a long-term bullish outlook. However, current technical indicators are bearish, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.1 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout signals provide a slight positive bias, but current market conditions and technical indicators remain weak.

SOL: 0.0 — While SOL has outperformed historically, recent technical indicators and market conditions do not provide a clear signal for immediate allocation changes.

DOGE: -0.1 — The dismissal of the manipulation lawsuit provides some stability, but overall bearish sentiment and lack of strong technical signals suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-09-03 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a general bearish sentiment, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by broader market weaknesses and inflation concerns. Despite the downturn, institutional interest in BTC remains strong, particularly with the potential for spot BTC ETFs. ETH is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential support at lower levels, though technical indicators suggest continued pressure. Solana shows resilience with strong historical performance despite large outflows, and Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, although a recent lawsuit dismissal provides some relief. The macroeconomic backdrop, with elevated volatility and inflation concerns, suggests a cautious approach, with potential for capital rotation towards stablecoins like USDT for risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, BTC is under pressure from macroeconomic factors and technical indicators suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for potential ETF-related inflows.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale accumulation providing some support, but technical indicators and broader market sentiment remain bearish. Holding current position.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent outflows, Solana's strong historical performance and defense of decentralization are positive. Slightly increasing exposure due to relative strength.

DOGE: -0.1 — Bearish sentiment persists, and the community's focus on alternative investments suggests caution. Reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for sentiment shifts.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the bearish market conditions and elevated volatility, increasing exposure to USDT as a defensive measure to preserve capital and manage risk."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with a recent slump in the crypto market linked to broader economic concerns such as rising inflation and weakness in U.S. stocks. Despite this, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, particularly regarding potential ETF inflows. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout patterns, although it faces seller pressure. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience despite large outflows, and Dogecoin sentiment is mixed following a legal dismissal and community interest in a new ICO. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a steady U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, with volatility remaining a concern as indicated by the VIX.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests long-term bullish potential, but current market conditions are cautious. A moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.2 — While ETH is near a potential breakout, the current selling pressure and technical patterns suggest a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite large outflows, SOL's strong performance and positive sentiment around decentralization support a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment and recent legal news provide no clear directional signal. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the cautious market sentiment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent, but a slight reduction is warranted to allocate more to other assets with better potential."
2024-09-03 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has experienced a slump, dragging its price below $58k, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains strong. Ethereum shows signs of potential breakout from a technical pattern, with whale accumulation suggesting underlying confidence. Solana's fundamentals remain robust despite large outflows, and it has shown resilience in performance. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, although a recent lawsuit dismissal could provide some relief. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite institutional interest in ETFs, the recent price slump and bearish macroeconomic indicators suggest caution. The lack of technical buy signals further supports a conservative stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and potential technical breakout from a wedge pattern indicate a moderate buying opportunity, although caution is warranted due to broader market conditions.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong performance and resilience despite outflows, along with positive news on decentralization, make it relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of a lawsuit provides some relief, but overall bearish sentiment and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish tilt in the market, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-09-03 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies experiencing slight fluctuations without strong directional momentum. Bitcoin's price is influenced by broader market dips linked to U.S. stock market weakness and inflation concerns, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a positive long-term factor. Ethereum shows signs of potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, with whale accumulation suggesting underlying support. Solana's narrative is mixed, with strong historical performance despite recent large outflows, and ongoing discussions about its decentralization. Dogecoin's sentiment remains bearish, with legal challenges dismissed but community interest shifting towards new opportunities. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price dips, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests a positive long-term outlook. However, current market conditions and low on-chain activity warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and potential technical breakout provide a slightly favorable outlook, though the market remains cautious overall.

SOL: +0.1 — While Solana has shown strong historical performance, recent outflows and decentralization concerns temper enthusiasm. The overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

DOGE: -0.1 — With bearish sentiment and community interest shifting away, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent. However, legal clarity provides some stability.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-09-03 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional interest in BTC ETFs provides a long-term bullish outlook. However, current market weakness suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout signal moderate optimism, though market conditions warrant caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong past performance and decentralization efforts support a positive outlook, even amid large outflows, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: -0.1 — Legal relief provides some support, but overall bearish sentiment and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest a cautious stance.

USDT: 0.0 — With market uncertainty and no significant news, maintaining a neutral position in USDT allows for flexibility in capital allocation."
2024-09-03 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a recent dip in crypto prices linked to broader market weakness and inflation concerns. Bitcoin has experienced a decline below $58k amid this slump, though institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a long-term bullish factor. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for a breakout, while Solana's performance remains resilient despite significant outflows. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, although a recent lawsuit dismissal may provide some relief. USDT remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests a long-term bullish outlook. However, current technical indicators are not supportive of a strong buy.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential breakout signals are positive, but current technicals remain mixed, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.1 — Solana's resilience and strong performance despite outflows are encouraging, but lack of immediate bullish signals suggests a modest allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Bearish sentiment and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure, though the lawsuit dismissal may limit downside risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market uncertainty and bearish conditions, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with a notable decline in prices across major cryptocurrencies, driven by broader market dips linked to U.S. stock weakness and inflation concerns. Despite the downturn, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, particularly with the potential for significant inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential support at current levels, although technical indicators suggest possible continued pressure. Solana has shown resilience despite large outflows, and recent news highlights its commitment to decentralization. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, but legal clarity regarding manipulation claims may provide some stability. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, institutional interest in BTC ETFs and long-term bullish outlooks provide a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.1 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout suggest a cautious buy, though current market pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.2 — Resilience in the face of outflows and positive news on decentralization support a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal clarity balanced by bearish trading conditions; maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a hedge against volatility."
