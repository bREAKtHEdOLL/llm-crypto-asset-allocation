2024-08-28 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. This downturn is exacerbated by a broader market sell-off and liquidation events, particularly affecting Bitcoin. Ethereum faces additional pressure from weak investor demand for spot ETFs and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong on-chain activity and user engagement, indicating underlying network strength. Dogecoin is relatively quiet, with no major developments aside from a scam alert. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable with bullish momentum, reflecting a flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and liquidation events, the increased on-chain activity suggests potential future recovery. However, the lack of bullish technical signals warrants a neutral stance for now.

ETH: -0.2 — Weak investor demand for spot ETFs and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation contribute to a negative outlook. The absence of bullish technical indicators further supports reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — While the price is under pressure, Solana's record daily active users and strong on-chain activity indicate potential resilience and future growth, justifying a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant developments and continued price weakness, Dogecoin remains neutral. The scam alert does not materially impact its market position.

USDT: +0.5 — With increased market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for capital preservation and potential future reallocation opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by a broader market sell-off and liquidation events. Bitcoin has faced a notable dip due to liquidation pressures, while Ethereum is experiencing weak investor demand, as indicated by ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a high level of daily active users, is struggling with price weakness, suggesting potential support retests. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is marred by scam alerts, while Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The market is experiencing a significant sell-off, and Bitcoin is under pressure from liquidation events and energy asset acquisitions affecting mining operations. Without current holdings, no reduction is possible, but caution is advised.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate bearish sentiment. Without current holdings, no reduction is possible, but caution is advised.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price weakness, Solana's record daily active users suggest underlying network strength, warranting a cautious hold with potential for future recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in data or sentiment, with the market largely stable aside from scam alerts. Neutral stance maintained.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk."
2024-08-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant liquidation wave, leading to a market dip below $58,000, compounded by external pressures from AI data centers acquiring energy resources from mining operations. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand, as evidenced by significant outflows from spot ETFs and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a record high in daily active users, is struggling with price weakness, suggesting a potential support retest. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is affected by scam alerts, which could impact investor confidence. Tether remains stable with no significant news, providing a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent liquidation wave and external pressures on mining operations suggest continued bearish sentiment, warranting caution.

ETH: -0.4 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate potential further downside, justifying a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price weakness, the record high in daily active users suggests underlying network strength, offering a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Scam alerts and lack of significant positive catalysts result in a neutral stance, with no clear directional bias.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-08-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects a cautious sentiment, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip driven by a liquidation wave, and Ethereum facing weak investor demand as evidenced by spot-ETF outflows. Solana, despite a high number of active users, is struggling with price weakness, indicating potential support level retests. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is affected by scam alerts, which could impact investor confidence. Tether remains steady with no significant news, suggesting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators show a stable environment with moderate volatility, but the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with a slight bearish tilt.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent dip and liquidation wave, there is no strong directional signal. The lack of buy signals in technical indicators suggests a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and recent sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate bearish sentiment. The lack of bullish technical signals supports a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — High daily active users suggest underlying network strength, but price weakness and potential support retests warrant a modest positive score.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, but caution is advised due to scam alerts affecting investor confidence.

USDT: +0.5 — With the current market uncertainty and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a stable hedge against volatility."
2024-08-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a mix of slight price increases and decreases across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a significant liquidation event, indicating potential bearish pressure, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and a large sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows strong user engagement despite price weakness, suggesting underlying network strength. Dogecoin's market activity is overshadowed by scam alerts, which may impact investor confidence. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent liquidations and bearish news, Bitcoin's price remains relatively stable. No strong buy or sell signals are present, suggesting a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.3 — The combination of ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicates bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user activity and engagement provide a positive outlook, despite recent price declines. The network's resilience suggests potential for recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — The absence of significant positive catalysts and the presence of scam alerts suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market uncertainty and mixed signals from other assets, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 17.11. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin facing a dip due to a liquidation wave and energy pressures from AI data centers. Ethereum is seeing weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation, which could weigh on its price. Solana, despite price weakness, is showing strong user engagement, suggesting underlying network strength. Dogecoin is dealing with scam-related news, which could affect investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its continued role as a safe haven during market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price dips and liquidation pressures, the lack of current holdings and mixed macro signals suggest a neutral stance. No strong buy or sell signals are present.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggest potential downward pressure. Without current holdings, a cautious approach is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user engagement and network activity provide a positive outlook, despite recent price weakness. Current holdings justify maintaining and potentially increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Scam-related news could dampen sentiment, but without current holdings, there is no immediate need to adjust exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and the stable nature of USDT, maintaining a higher allocation to stablecoins is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a cautious sentiment with a mix of bearish and neutral signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a dip driven by a liquidation wave and pressure from AI data centers acquiring energy assets, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by spot-ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price weakness, shows strong user engagement with record daily active users, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news affecting its market dynamics. Tether maintains its stability with no major news, suggesting its continued role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price dips and liquidation pressures, the lack of a strong buy signal and mixed news sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate bearish sentiment, warranting caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong user engagement and high transaction activity provide a positive outlook, despite recent price weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in market data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment and lack of strong bullish signals in other assets, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent for stability."
2024-08-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by a broad market sell-off and significant liquidations, especially in Bitcoin. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand, as evidenced by ETF outflows and the Ethereum Foundation's large sell-off. Solana, despite a high level of user activity, is experiencing price weakness, while Dogecoin is dealing with security concerns due to a scam alert. In this environment, USDT remains stable, reflecting a cautious market stance with a preference for holding stable assets amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off and liquidation wave, there is no strong technical or on-chain signal to suggest a buy or sell action. The market remains cautious.

ETH: 0.0 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggest caution. However, no technical signals warrant an immediate reduction or increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Despite high user activity, the significant price drop and potential for further declines suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk in the current bearish environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — The absence of strong technical signals and the recent scam alert suggest maintaining a neutral stance without current holdings to reduce.

USDT: +0.5 — The stablecoin's bullish technical indicators and the current market volatility make it an attractive option for preserving capital and mitigating risk."
2024-08-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously bearish, with a recent wave of liquidations impacting Bitcoin and broader market sell-offs affecting other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing pressure from liquidation events and energy asset acquisitions by tech firms, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and significant selling by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a high level of user activity, is struggling with price weakness, indicating potential support retests. Dogecoin's market is relatively quiet aside from a scam alert, and Tether remains stable without significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — The recent liquidation wave and energy asset acquisitions are negative for Bitcoin, suggesting caution despite no current holdings.

ETH: -0.3 — Weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation indicate bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price weakness, record daily usage suggests underlying strength, justifying a modest positive allocation given current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of bearish market conditions and as a safe haven, maintaining a higher allocation to USDT is prudent for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a slight bearish undertone. Bitcoin has experienced a significant liquidation wave, causing a dip in price, while Ethereum is facing weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a recent price drop, shows strong user engagement, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin's market activity remains low, with a recent scam alert impacting sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT maintains stability, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility. Overall, the market is experiencing a cautious sentiment with some assets showing signs of recovery.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidation-driven dips, Bitcoin's price is recovering, and on-chain activity remains robust, suggesting potential for a rebound.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand indicate bearish sentiment, warranting caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user engagement and transaction activity suggest underlying strength despite recent price weakness, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Low on-chain activity and recent scam alerts create a neutral outlook, with no strong signals for allocation changes.

USDT: -0.4 — As some assets show signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin exposure could be beneficial to capitalize on potential upward movements in the market."
2024-08-28 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with recent volatility and a significant liquidation wave impacting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable sell-off, driven by liquidations and external pressures from AI data centers. Ethereum faces challenges with weak investor demand as evidenced by spot-ETF outflows and significant selling by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows strong on-chain activity despite price weakness, indicating underlying user engagement. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with no significant positive catalysts, while Tether maintains its role as a stable asset amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation wave and external pressures suggest caution, despite some recovery in price momentum.

ETH: -0.2 — Continued sell pressure from the Ethereum Foundation and weak investor demand signal caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and user engagement provide a positive outlook despite recent price declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant positive news and ongoing scam alerts suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and mixed sentiment, maintaining some exposure to stable assets is prudent."
2024-08-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent price increases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL, yet no clear buy signals from technical indicators. Bitcoin experienced a significant liquidation event, which may introduce caution among traders. Ethereum's recent sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation and ETF outflows suggest weak investor demand, despite some bullish momentum signals. Solana shows strong on-chain activity, indicating potential resilience despite price weakness. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet, with no significant developments aside from a scam alert. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a cautious but stable market outlook. 

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidation-driven dips, BTC shows some bullish momentum. However, the lack of strong buy signals and external pressures from energy asset acquisitions warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but weak investor demand from ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Holding a neutral stance seems prudent.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage suggest underlying strength, despite recent price weakness. This makes SOL relatively attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant positive developments and low on-chain activity, maintaining a neutral position is advisable.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the mixed market signals and some bullish momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings could be justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight price increases and bullish momentum signals despite recent market corrections. Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum, but recent liquidation events and energy asset acquisitions by tech firms may pose challenges. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand, highlighted by ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation.

Tether remains a stable anchor with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent liquidation concerns, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook. However, energy asset acquisition by tech firms could pose risks.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand indicate bearish sentiment, warranting caution despite bullish momentum signals.

SOL: +0.6 — High user activity and bullish momentum suggest strong network engagement, making Solana relatively attractive despite recent price weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in data or sentiment, Dogecoin remains neutral, especially given the recent scam alert.

USDT: +0.2 — While generally stable, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent in the current market environment, providing liquidity and risk management amid mixed market signals."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of bearish sentiment and technical signals. Bitcoin has experienced a significant dip driven by a liquidation wave, and Ethereum is facing weak investor demand as evidenced by spot ETF outflows and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Despite these challenges, Solana shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, though its price remains under pressure. Dogecoin is relatively stable but lacks any positive catalysts, while Tether remains a safe haven with no significant news impacting its stability. Overall, the market is experiencing volatility with a cautious outlook, suggesting a preference for stability and careful capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation and energy concerns create a bearish outlook despite bullish momentum signals. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bearish news on ETF outflows and foundation sell-offs, balanced by bullish momentum. No current holdings to reduce.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and user growth provide a positive outlook, but price weakness suggests caution. Maintain current holdings with a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant changes in data or sentiment, coupled with scam alerts, suggests a neutral stance. No current holdings to adjust.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in other assets, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-28 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bearish undertones. Bitcoin has experienced a significant dip driven by a wave of liquidations, and there is pressure from AI data centers acquiring energy resources from miners. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand as evidenced by spot-ETF outflows and a significant sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, but its price has struggled, reflecting broader market corrections. Dogecoin has been relatively stable, with no significant market-moving news aside from a scam alert. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating a neutral stance in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy competition from AI data centers present downside risks. The overall market sentiment is cautious, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.5 — The significant sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation and weak ETF demand indicate bearish sentiment. Although there is bullish momentum, the macroeconomic context and recent news suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage provide a positive outlook despite recent price weakness. The potential for a support retest suggests a cautious but slightly positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in data or sentiment, and the recent scam alert not affecting fundamentals, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets and the need for a safe haven, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-08-28 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of bearish sentiment and some pockets of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a sell-off driven by liquidation pressures and external factors such as energy asset acquisition by tech firms, which could impact mining operations. Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation, indicating a cautious outlook. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong user engagement, suggesting potential resilience. Dogecoin's market remains relatively stable, though marred by scam alerts. Tether remains a stable haven amid these fluctuations, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the liquidation wave and external pressures on mining suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Maintain a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user engagement and activity despite price weakness indicate potential for recovery. Increase exposure moderately.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, and scam alerts suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the overall market uncertainty and bearish signals, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-08-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent market corrections and liquidation events. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip driven by a liquidation wave, while Ethereum faces weak investor demand as evidenced by spot ETF outflows and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong on-chain activity with record daily usage, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is marred by scam alerts, which could affect investor confidence. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy concerns from AI data centers suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly due to potential downside risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but overshadowed by weak ETF demand and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Holding neutral as the market digests these developments.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and record daily usage provide a positive outlook despite recent price weakness. Potential for recovery as user engagement remains high.

DOGE: 0.0 — Stable technicals and momentum, but scam alerts could dampen investor sentiment. Maintaining a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and bearish tendencies, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a defensive measure to manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a dip driven by a liquidation wave, highlighting some bearish pressure. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand as evidenced by spot-ETF outflows and the Ethereum Foundation's significant sell-off. Solana, despite its price struggles, shows strong network activity with record daily usage, suggesting underlying strength. Dogecoin's market is relatively stable, though it faces external threats from scams. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment, where risk assets might still find some support.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent liquidation events and energy concerns are weighing on Bitcoin, despite some bullish momentum signals. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with strong technicals but weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Neutral stance recommended.

SOL: +0.5 — High on-chain activity and record daily usage indicate strong network fundamentals, suggesting a buy despite recent price weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, with the primary concern being external scam threats. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for further volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against market fluctuations."
2024-08-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with recent price increases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, indicating a potential recovery from the previous dip. However, macroeconomic factors such as stable interest rates and a moderate VIX suggest a balanced risk environment. Bitcoin faces challenges from liquidation pressures and energy competition, while Ethereum sees weak demand in spot ETFs and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana shows strong user engagement despite price weakness, and Dogecoin is dealing with scam-related news. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidation pressures, BTC shows bullish momentum and a significant price recovery, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but weak investor demand and significant sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user engagement and a recent price rebound indicate potential upside, despite broader market corrections.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE has shown a price increase, the lack of significant positive news and ongoing scam alerts suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases with the recovery in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to allocate more capital to promising assets."
2024-08-28 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a dip driven by a liquidation wave and external pressures from energy asset acquisitions by tech firms. Ethereum is facing weak investor demand, as evidenced by significant outflows from spot ETFs and a large sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation. Solana, despite a price decline, shows strong user engagement with record daily active users, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin is relatively stable but is dealing with scam-related news, which could affect investor confidence. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the liquidation-driven dip and energy sector pressures suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — The sell-off by the Ethereum Foundation and ETF outflows indicate weak demand, balancing out the bullish technical signals. Maintain a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong user engagement and a potential support level retest suggest some resilience despite recent price weakness. Maintain a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Scam-related news and mixed price signals warrant a neutral position, especially with no current holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for further volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-28 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bullish momentum observed in technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. However, recent news highlights potential headwinds, such as liquidation events affecting BTC and significant ETH outflows from spot ETFs, indicating weak investor demand. Solana shows strong user engagement despite a price correction, while Dogecoin faces security concerns due to scam alerts. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent liquidation-driven price dips, BTC maintains bullish momentum technically. However, caution is warranted due to external pressures from energy asset acquisitions affecting mining operations.

ETH: -0.2 — While technical indicators remain positive, significant outflows from spot ETFs and large sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation suggest potential downside risk, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user engagement and bullish momentum, despite recent price weakness, suggest potential for recovery. The high daily active users signal underlying strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite positive technical momentum, security concerns from scam alerts and lack of significant news keep sentiment neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With mixed signals in the broader crypto market, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent, but a slight reduction is justified as other assets show potential for gains."
2024-08-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment reflects a relatively stable outlook with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals with Bitcoin facing a liquidation-driven dip and Ethereum witnessing significant outflows from spot ETFs. Solana shows strong user engagement despite price weakness, while Dogecoin is dealing with scam-related news. Tether remains stable with no significant news. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious with some bearish undertones, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, while Solana's user activity suggests potential resilience.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite bullish momentum signals, Bitcoin is under pressure from liquidation events and energy asset acquisitions by tech firms, indicating potential downside risk.

**ETH: -0.2** — The outflows from spot ETFs and the Ethereum Foundation's selloff contribute to a bearish outlook, despite technical buy signals.

**SOL: +0.4** — Strong user engagement and transaction activity provide a positive outlook, even as the price remains under pressure. This suggests potential for recovery.

**DOGE: 0.0** — The lack of significant positive developments and the presence of scam alerts result in a neutral stance, with no immediate catalysts for price movement.

**USDT: +0.1** — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential downside in major cryptocurrencies, a slight preference for holding stablecoins is warranted to manage risk."
2024-08-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with some bearish undertones, particularly due to recent liquidation waves affecting Bitcoin and significant sell-offs in Ethereum by the Ethereum Foundation. Bitcoin's price has been under pressure due to broader market sell-offs and energy resource reallocations. Ethereum is also experiencing weak investor demand as evidenced by ETF outflows. Solana, despite a price dip, shows strong user engagement, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin remains relatively stable but is marred by scam alerts, which could affect investor confidence. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent liquidation wave and energy reallocation concerns create a bearish outlook. Current holdings should be reduced slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but significant sell-offs and weak ETF demand. No current holdings to reduce, so maintain a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong user engagement despite price weakness suggests potential resilience. Maintain a slight positive bias given existing holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical signals, the scam alert could dampen investor sentiment. No current holdings, so maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for further volatility, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-08-29 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish momentum across several cryptocurrencies, despite recent price fluctuations. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, although analysts warn of potential price shocks due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant upward movement until later in the year, while Solana is seeing increased user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could be positive for its adoption. Dogecoin has seen a legal win that might boost investor confidence, and Tether's strong reserve report supports its stability as a safe haven asset. Overall, the market is showing signs of cautious optimism with potential for volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the potential for price shocks, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but the news of delayed breakout and resistance at $2,700 tempers enthusiasm, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a strong case for increased allocation, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk may boost sentiment, and the bullish momentum suggests a cautious buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of cautious optimism, reducing USDT exposure in favor of more volatile assets seems prudent, though its strong reserve position remains a positive factor."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a steady U.S. Dollar Index. The cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin experiencing potential volatility due to external liquidity factors, while Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700. Solana is seeing increased user activity, which might be a positive sign despite its price stagnation. Dogecoin has received a boost in sentiment following the dismissal of a major lawsuit involving Elon Musk. Tether remains a stable choice, with strong reserve backing reported by Bitget.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the potential for volatility, BTC shows bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — While ETH has bullish momentum, the resistance at $2,700 and news of delayed breakout keep the outlook neutral for now.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong user activity and potential Binance integration indicate positive sentiment, warranting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a sentiment boost, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-08-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most cryptocurrencies, despite mixed macroeconomic indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing increased on-chain activity and bullish momentum, although analysts warn of potential price shocks due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with expectations of a delayed breakout. Solana is seeing a surge in daily active users and potential new integrations, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, while Tether's strong reserve backing reinforces its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the potential for macro-driven volatility, Bitcoin shows strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation as it holds potential for future gains.

SOL: +0.6 — The surge in daily active users and potential Binance integration are positive indicators, supporting a higher allocation to capitalize on future growth.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although legal news is positive, there are no significant changes in technical indicators or market activity to justify altering the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2024-08-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing bullish momentum despite a lack of a clear trend signal. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant movement until later in the year. Solana is witnessing increased user activity, which is a positive sign despite price stagnation. Dogecoin has seen a legal win with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, which could stabilize sentiment. Tether remains a safe haven with strong reserve backing, as evidenced by Bitget's proof-of-reserves data.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a trend signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors warrant a moderately positive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is struggling to break resistance, and with no immediate catalysts for a breakout, a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a strong positive sentiment, making Solana relatively attractive.

DOGE: +0.3 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, improving sentiment and justifying a slight positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall positive sentiment in other assets and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is appropriate."
2024-08-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. The crypto market is experiencing bullish momentum, particularly for BTC and ETH, with both showing strong on-chain activity and positive momentum signals. Despite a lack of a clear buy signal from trend indicators, the overall sentiment remains positive. Solana is seeing a surge in daily active users, which is a bullish sign, although its price has been stagnant. Dogecoin has benefited from positive legal news, which could bolster sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with strong reserve backing, but in a bullish market, capital may rotate out of stablecoins in favor of riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a trend buy signal, BTC shows strong bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting potential for upward movement.

ETH: +0.3 — While ETH faces resistance at $2,700, its bullish momentum and consistent buy signals indicate a positive outlook, albeit with some caution due to resistance concerns.

SOL: +0.6 — The increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration are strong bullish signals, making SOL an attractive asset despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a legal overhang, providing a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain largely unchanged.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-08-29 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum despite mixed macroeconomic signals. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by potential liquidity injections from the Federal Reserve, which could lead to significant price movements. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see a breakout until later in the year, while Solana is gaining traction with a rise in daily active users and potential integration hints from Binance. Dogecoin has received a positive sentiment boost following the dismissal of a major lawsuit against Elon Musk. Tether remains stable, with strong reserves reported by Bitget, indicating robust trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the lack of a clear buy signal, bullish momentum and potential liquidity injections suggest a favorable outlook. The current macroeconomic context supports a cautious increase in BTC exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Although facing resistance, Ethereum's consistent bullish momentum and technical indicators warrant a modest increase in allocation, anticipating a potential breakout in the future.

SOL: +0.5 — The increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a strong case for Solana's growth, justifying a higher allocation despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from the lawsuit dismissal and continued bullish momentum suggest a slight increase in exposure, although the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With rising risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-08-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is steady, and gold prices are high, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin shows bullish momentum, but analysts warn of potential price shocks due to U.S. Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum faces resistance, delaying potential breakouts. Solana's user activity is at a peak, hinting at strong network engagement, while Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news. Tether's strong reserve report boosts confidence in its stability. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with selective bullish signals across assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite warnings of potential price shocks, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technicals are strong, but resistance levels and delayed breakout expectations warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a strong bullish signal, despite price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive legal news and consistent bullish momentum support a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets and strong market confidence, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions, with moderate volatility in the S&P 500 and a stable U.S. Dollar Index. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum with positive technical indicators, though analysts warn of potential price shocks due to Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see significant upward movement until later in the year. Solana is showing strong user engagement and potential integration with Binance, which could be a positive catalyst. Dogecoin has seen a legal win with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, potentially stabilizing sentiment. Tether remains a safe haven with strong reserve backing, as evidenced by Bitget's proof-of-reserves report.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the warning of potential price shocks, Bitcoin's strong momentum and positive technical indicators suggest continued upward potential. The macro environment supports risk assets, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technicals are solid, but the resistance level and delayed breakout potential limit its attractiveness. A modest positive score reflects its stability and potential for future gains.

SOL: +0.8 — Strong user engagement and potential Binance integration provide a bullish outlook. Solana's technical indicators are improving, making it the most attractive asset currently.

DOGE: +0.1 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk is a positive sentiment driver, but technicals remain stable. A slight positive score reflects this sentiment improvement.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets and a stable macro environment, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and positive trend indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic catalysts such as U.S. Federal Reserve liquidity injections, which could lead to significant price adjustments. Ethereum, while showing bullish technicals, faces resistance and might not see a breakout until later in the year. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and potential integration news from Binance, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, but its price remains relatively stable. Tether's strong reserve backing continues to bolster its stability, making it a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic catalysts suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are positive, resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Surge in daily active users and potential Binance integration provide positive sentiment, justifying increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — Legal news provides a slight boost in sentiment, but overall market conditions remain stable.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, some capital can be rotated out of USDT to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."
2024-08-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakout, supported by bullish technical indicators and recent news about possible significant price movements due to U.S. Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum, while technically strong, faces resistance and may not see a major breakout until later in the year. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users, possibly driven by speculation around new Binance-related developments. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has seen a legal victory that could improve sentiment. USDT remains stable, with strong reserve backing, but the current environment suggests a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and a potential breakout, supported by both technical indicators and news of possible price shocks due to macroeconomic factors.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum is technically bullish, it faces resistance and lacks immediate catalysts for a breakout, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increase in daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a strong positive outlook, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, improving sentiment and supporting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation into riskier assets."
2024-08-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by bullish technical indicators and on-chain activity, although analysts warn of potential volatility due to macroeconomic factors such as U.S. Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with expectations of a delayed breakout, while Solana benefits from increased daily active users and potential Binance integration. Dogecoin sees a positive sentiment boost from the dismissal of a major lawsuit, and Tether's strong reserve backing supports confidence in its stability. The macroeconomic environment, with a stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility, suggests a conducive atmosphere for risk-on behavior, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and potential breakout above the upper Bollinger Band, combined with positive on-chain activity, make BTC an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While ETH shows bullish momentum, the resistance at $2,700 and news of a delayed breakout suggest a more cautious approach compared to BTC.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration create a positive outlook, supported by strong technical indicators and on-chain activity.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from the lawsuit dismissal and consistent bullish momentum warrant a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish trends in other assets, capital rotation out of USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-08-29 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by potential liquidity injections from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could lead to significant price movements. Ethereum, while showing bullish technical signals, faces resistance and may not see a breakout until later in the year. Solana is experiencing increased user activity and speculation around potential Binance integration, which could be supportive of its price. Dogecoin has seen a positive legal outcome with the dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk, which may improve sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with strong reserves reported by Bitget, indicating trust in its solvency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential for significant price movements due to macroeconomic factors make Bitcoin an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum, resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations suggest a cautious approach with a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a strong case for increased allocation, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment following the dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk could lead to increased interest and price appreciation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the market, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic influences such as U.S. Federal Reserve actions, which could lead to significant price movements. Ethereum, while also showing bullish momentum, faces resistance and is not expected to break out significantly in the near term. Solana is benefiting from increased user activity and potential integration news, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin has seen a positive legal outcome, potentially stabilizing sentiment around it. Meanwhile, Tether remains a stable asset, with strong reserve backing enhancing its reliability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic catalysts suggest further upside potential. The possibility of a major price shock due to Federal Reserve actions adds to the attractiveness of increasing exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum, resistance at the $2,700 level and delayed breakout expectations temper enthusiasm. However, it remains a solid hold given the overall market conditions.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive news regarding user activity and potential Binance integration supports a favorable outlook. The asset's strong on-chain activity and bullish technicals further justify increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, providing a slight positive sentiment boost. However, the lack of significant technical or on-chain developments keeps the score modest.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a strategic opportunity to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets to capture potential gains."
2024-08-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with strong technical indicators and momentum signals for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout scenario, supported by increased on-chain activity and positive momentum, although analysts warn of possible volatility due to macroeconomic factors. Ethereum faces resistance but maintains a bullish technical setup. Solana is seeing strong user engagement and potential integration news, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, which could bolster confidence. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with strong reserve backing, but may see reduced demand as investors rotate into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with potential breakout signals and increased on-chain activity. Despite warnings of volatility, the technical setup remains favorable.

ETH: +0.5 — While Ethereum faces resistance, the overall technical indicators are positive, and the market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana benefits from high user engagement and potential integration news, making it attractive for capital allocation despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive legal news and steady technical indicators suggest a moderate increase in allocation, though the asset remains less volatile compared to others.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans bullish, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness in the current environment."
2024-08-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin shows potential for a significant price move due to anticipated Federal Reserve actions, while Ethereum faces resistance and may not see major gains soon. Solana is experiencing high user activity and potential integration with Binance, which could drive interest. Dogecoin benefits from positive legal news, potentially improving sentiment. Tether remains a safe haven with strong reserve backing, but in a risk-on environment, capital may rotate out of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential for a major price move due to macroeconomic factors. On-chain activity supports bullish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technicals, resistance at $2,700 and news of delayed breakout suggest a hold position.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration are positive indicators, despite recent price stagnation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from legal news and bullish technical indicators warrant a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — In a risk-on environment, capital may rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-08-29 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and positive trend indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing potential volatility due to anticipated Federal Reserve actions, while Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, possibly delaying a breakout. Solana's user activity is at a yearly high, and speculation around Binance's potential integration could provide further upside. Dogecoin benefits from a positive legal outcome for Elon Musk, which may stabilize sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT's robust reserve data from Bitget enhances trust in its stability, though it remains a lower-risk asset in a market showing signs of risk-on behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential volatility from macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and on-chain activity suggests continued interest.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum's technicals remain positive. However, the news of a delayed breakout tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration provide strong bullish signals, making Solana relatively attractive.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive legal news and stable technical indicators support a modest increase in allocation, though no major catalysts are present.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500 index, indicating a generally positive risk sentiment. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies shows a mixed picture. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant price decreases in the last hour, despite maintaining bullish momentum signals in prior hours. Solana and Dogecoin are showing signs of potential breakdowns, with prices falling below lower Bollinger Bands. News highlights include potential major price movements for Bitcoin due to Federal Reserve actions and Solana's increasing user activity, which could support its price in the future. Meanwhile, Ethereum's breakout is expected to be delayed, and Dogecoin has seen a legal win that might stabilize sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, Bitcoin maintains bullish momentum signals and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors. The overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is struggling with resistance and has experienced a significant price decrease. The news suggests a potential delay in upward movement, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's increasing daily active users and potential Binance integration are positive indicators, despite recent price declines. This suggests a potential recovery and growth opportunity.

DOGE: 0.0 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk is positive, but the recent price breakdown suggests caution. No strong signals to adjust current holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for recovery in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in broader markets. In the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing mixed signals with recent price declines but maintain a bullish trend signal. Solana is experiencing increased user activity, which is a positive sign despite its price stagnation. Dogecoin has seen a legal win with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, which could stabilize sentiment. USDT remains a stable choice with strong reserve backing, as confirmed by Bitget's proof-of-reserves report.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin maintains a bullish trend signal, and potential liquidity injections could lead to upward price adjustments.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, and with no immediate breakout expected, a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, making Solana relatively attractive.

DOGE: +0.2 — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk removes a significant overhang, potentially stabilizing sentiment.

USDT: -0.4 — With a stable macro backdrop and some positive signals in other cryptocurrencies, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-08-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent declines. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by potential liquidity injections from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could lead to significant price adjustments. Ethereum, however, faces resistance and may not see a breakout until later in the year. Solana is gaining traction with a peak in daily active users and potential integration with Binance, which could drive future interest. Dogecoin's legal clarity following the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk provides a stable backdrop, while Tether's strong reserve position reinforces confidence in its stability. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, suggests a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors make it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a slight price increase, Ethereum's resistance at $2,700 and delayed breakout expectations suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in user activity and potential Binance integration enhance Solana's attractiveness, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in technicals or sentiment, maintaining current exposure to Dogecoin is appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.65. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.34, suggesting a stable dollar, while gold prices are elevated, indicating a potential hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows mixed signals with a potential for a significant price move due to anticipated Federal Reserve actions. Ethereum faces resistance and may not see a breakout soon. Solana's user activity is at a peak, which could be a positive indicator despite price stagnation. Dogecoin has seen legal clarity with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, which could stabilize sentiment. USDT remains a stable choice with strong reserve backing, as evidenced by Bitget's proof-of-reserves.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, Bitcoin's potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors and strong on-chain activity suggests a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing resistance and lacks strong momentum or news catalysts, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide positive sentiment, although technical indicators remain weak.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal clarity from the lawsuit dismissal could stabilize sentiment, but technicals are still weak, justifying a cautious buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively stable risk environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum show mixed signals with no strong momentum, while Solana is experiencing increased user activity despite price stagnation. Dogecoin has seen a legal victory that could boost sentiment, while Tether remains a stable option with strong reserve backing. Overall, the market is in a cautious phase with no clear bullish or bearish trend, encouraging a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential for a significant price move due to macroeconomic factors and liquidity injections suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

**ETH: 0.0** — Ethereum is facing resistance and is unlikely to see a breakout soon. The technicals are neutral, warranting a hold position.

**SOL: +0.5** — Increased daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, making Solana relatively more attractive despite recent price stagnation.

**DOGE: +0.2** — The dismissal of the lawsuit against Elon Musk could improve sentiment, but technical indicators remain neutral, suggesting a modest increase in allocation.

**USDT: -0.2** — With no strong bearish signals in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to reallocate capital towards more promising assets."
2024-08-29 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index. Bitcoin shows mixed signals with a potential for a significant price move due to Federal Reserve actions, while Ethereum is facing resistance and may not see a breakout until later in the year. Solana's user activity is at a high, and potential integration with Binance could be a positive catalyst. Dogecoin has seen legal clarity with the dismissal of a lawsuit against Elon Musk, which could stabilize sentiment. Tether's strong reserve position reinforces its stability as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential for a significant move due to macroeconomic factors and liquidity injections makes BTC relatively attractive. Maintain a moderate allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technicals are neutral with resistance at $2,700, and news suggests no significant movement in the short term. Hold current position.

SOL: +0.3 — High daily active users and potential Binance integration provide a positive outlook, though price stagnation tempers enthusiasm. Slightly increase allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal clarity is a positive, but technical signals remain neutral. Maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish developments in other assets and strong reserve backing, reduce stablecoin holdings slightly to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-08-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders, which could provide a bullish foundation despite recent price dips. Ethereum's market activity is mixed, with notable transactions by its co-founder and debates around its network activity. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and memecoin activity, highlighting its network's strengths. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating stability in their respective markets. Macroeconomic indicators like a stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility suggest a relatively calm broader market environment, which could support risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Accumulation by large holders and stable macro conditions suggest a potential for upward movement, despite recent price dips.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from technical indicators and market activity, with no clear direction from recent news.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user growth, along with positive sentiment from memecoin activity, support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been trading within a tight range, with large holders continuing to accumulate, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent dips. Ethereum is experiencing some volatility with notable on-chain activity, but broader interest appears to be waning. Solana is showing strong network adoption with a record surge in daily active users, highlighting its high-speed and low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable environment for these assets. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautious but stable market outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish outlook. The tight trading range indicates stability, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from on-chain activity and recent volatility, combined with a lack of strong bullish indicators, suggest a hold position for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and increased daily active users highlight Solana's growth potential, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, DOGE remains a neutral hold.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential bullish sentiment in BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-08-30 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low VIX and a strong S&P 500, indicating a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight dip below $60K, but large holders are accumulating, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Ethereum is seeing some volatility with mixed signals from network activity and founder transactions. Solana is witnessing a surge in daily active users, highlighting its growing adoption and network strength. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, with DOGE showing some bullish momentum in recent technicals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price dip, large wallet accumulation suggests a bullish foundation, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from network activity and founder transactions create uncertainty, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Record daily active users and network adoption highlight Solana's potential, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Slight bullish momentum in technicals, but lack of significant news keeps the signal modestly positive.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally stable macro environment and positive signals from other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is appropriate."
2024-08-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mixed sentiment with a slightly bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing a period of consolidation below $60K, with on-chain data indicating accumulation by large holders, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips. Ethereum shows signs of volatility, with notable movements by its co-founder and a rebound from recent lows, although broader interest appears to be waning. Solana is seeing positive network activity with record daily active users and increased interest in its ecosystem, driven by the memecoin wave. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable position. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, accumulation by large holders suggests a potential bullish setup. However, the lack of strong upward momentum tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent volatility and strategic moves by Vitalik Buterin. The market remains undecided, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network activity and user growth highlight Solana’s potential, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a hold position, with no clear direction.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against market fluctuations."
2024-08-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously bearish, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight declines in price over the past few hours. Bitcoin is trading below $60K, with significant accumulation by large wallets, suggesting potential future support. Ethereum has seen some internal movements by its co-founder, which may have caused mild market reactions, but overall, it remains in a downtrend. Solana is showing signs of increased network activity and adoption, highlighted by a new record in daily active users, which could be a positive indicator for future growth. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, and their market data does not suggest any strong directional moves. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the current price dip, large wallet accumulation suggests potential support and a bullish foundation in the medium term.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with internal movements by Vitalik Buterin and a lack of strong upward momentum keep Ethereum in a neutral position.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive network activity and adoption trends, along with the memecoin wave, suggest potential for growth despite current price declines.

DOGE: -0.1 — Slight bearish sentiment due to lack of significant news and price decline, but no strong sell signals as momentum remains mixed.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility and potential further declines in risk assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight dip below $60K, driven by U.S. session weakness, but large holders are accumulating, suggesting a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum has seen some volatility, with notable movements by co-founder Vitalik Buterin, but remains in a recovery phase from recent lows. Solana is gaining traction with a record surge in daily active users, highlighting its growing adoption and network advantages. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, with Dogecoin showing some bullish momentum in technical indicators. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement in select assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent dip, the accumulation by large holders and on-chain activity suggest a potential bullish setup. The macroeconomic context is stable, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent rebound and network activity, despite mixed sentiment, indicate a cautiously optimistic outlook. The move by Vitalik Buterin is not seen as a negative catalyst.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's record daily active users and network strengths position it favorably for capital allocation. The positive news and price increase support a higher score.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some bullish momentum in technical indicators, the lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential for upward movement in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-08-30 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility and moderate interest rates, suggesting a neutral risk environment. Bitcoin is experiencing a consolidation phase with large wallets accumulating, indicating potential bullish sentiment despite recent price dips. Ethereum's market activity is mixed, with notable movements by its co-founder hinting at cautious sentiment. Solana is seeing increased network activity and adoption, driven by its technological advantages, which is a positive sign for its growth potential. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, maintaining their current market positions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Accumulation by large holders suggests potential upside, despite recent price dips. The stable macro environment supports maintaining a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from recent market activity and co-founder actions suggest caution. Holding current positions seems prudent until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user adoption are positive indicators, suggesting potential for further gains. The asset's technological edge is attracting new users.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable market data imply no immediate changes are necessary. Holding current positions is advisable.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish signals in BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings can facilitate capital rotation into more promising assets."
2024-08-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.0. The U.S. dollar index is slightly low at 101.7, which may support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a tug-of-war between Asian buying and U.S. selling, but large wallets are accumulating, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Ethereum's market is reacting to significant movements by its co-founder, and while it has rebounded from recent lows, it still faces mixed sentiment. Solana is seeing increased network activity and adoption, driven by its high-speed, low-cost advantages. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable outlook for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, large wallet accumulation suggests a bullish foundation. The macro environment is supportive of risk assets, making BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Mixed signals from technical indicators and recent sell pressure, but network activity and Vitalik's movements indicate underlying strength. A cautious buy signal is warranted.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user growth highlight Solana's potential, supported by its technological advantages. This makes it a compelling choice for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance. No clear signals to increase or decrease exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for bullish sentiment in risk assets, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing mixed signals, with large wallet accumulations suggesting potential bullishness despite recent price dips below $60K. Ethereum's market activity is influenced by notable transactions from its co-founder, but broader interest remains tepid. Solana is gaining traction with record daily active users and increased network adoption, highlighting its high-speed, low-cost advantages. Dogecoin shows some positive momentum, though lacking significant news. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, which may support risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, large wallet accumulation indicates potential for upward movement. However, technical indicators remain mixed.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent transactions by Vitalik Buterin and mixed market sentiment keep Ethereum in a holding pattern, with no clear directional bias.

SOL: +0.6 — Record daily active users and strong network adoption provide a bullish outlook, supported by positive momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum is present, but the lack of significant news limits the strength of the signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With some assets showing bullish potential, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with some bullish undertones. Bitcoin has seen accumulation by large wallets, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips below $60K. Ethereum's market sentiment is cautious, with significant moves by its co-founder and ongoing debates about its network activity. Solana is experiencing strong user growth and adoption, highlighted by a record in daily active users and interest in Solana-native memecoins. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, indicating stable but unremarkable conditions. Overall, the market shows pockets of optimism, particularly in Solana and Bitcoin, while Ethereum remains in a state of cautious observation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large wallets suggests a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, supporting a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent sell pressure from a major holder and debates on network activity. The market remains uncertain, warranting a hold position.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong network adoption and user growth, along with bullish momentum signals, make SOL attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in market data to justify altering the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive signals in BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-30 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of accumulation in Bitcoin, as large wallets continue to add to their holdings, indicating reduced selling pressure. Ethereum, while experiencing some internal movements by its co-founder, shows a mixed sentiment with ongoing debates about its network activity versus broader interest. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and memecoin activity, highlighting its network's strengths. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, indicating a relatively stable environment for these assets. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, suggesting a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Accumulation by large wallets and bullish momentum signals suggest a positive outlook, despite recent price dips.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with internal movements and debates on network activity; no clear directional trend.

SOL: +0.6 — Record daily active users and memecoin activity highlight strong network adoption, supporting a bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation by large holders, suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite recent price dips below $60K. Ethereum's market activity is mixed, with notable transactions by its co-founder and a rebound from recent lows, yet it faces broader interest challenges. Solana is experiencing a surge in daily active users and memecoin activity, highlighting its network's growing adoption and technological advantages. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, but Dogecoin's technical indicators suggest bullish momentum. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no drastic changes in key indicators like interest rates or volatility, allowing for a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Accumulation by large holders and bullish momentum indicate a positive outlook, though price remains below key resistance levels.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent co-founder transactions and sideways technicals; maintaining a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network activity and user growth support a bullish view, with technical indicators also favorable.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite no significant news, technical indicators show bullish momentum, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally optimistic market outlook, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more towards growth assets."
2024-08-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with significant price declines observed in the last hour across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL, which have all dropped below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Despite this, there are bullish signals in the form of large BTC wallet accumulations and increased on-chain activity for SOL, suggesting underlying support. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility (VIX at 15.0) and a steady U.S. Dollar Index, which may provide a neutral backdrop for crypto markets. The absence of significant news for DOGE and USDT suggests a lack of immediate catalysts for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, the accumulation by large wallets and bullish on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to the recent breakdown.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant price decrease and mixed signals from technical indicators and on-chain activity. The recent actions by Vitalik Buterin may also contribute to uncertainty.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and a record surge in daily active users indicate robust network adoption, despite the recent price decline.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in on-chain activity. The technical indicators are mixed, with bullish momentum but recent price decline.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the recent volatility and price declines in other assets, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT can provide stability and liquidity for potential re-entries."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.0. The U.S. dollar index is at 101.7, suggesting a neutral to slightly strong dollar environment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin has shown some weakness, dipping below $60K, but large holders are accumulating, which could provide a bullish foundation. Ethereum has experienced significant price volatility, with notable on-chain activity and a recent rebound from lows. Solana is seeing increased network adoption, highlighted by a record in daily active users and a surge in memecoin activity. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, but Dogecoin's technical indicators remain mixed with some bullish signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests potential for a rebound. The overall market sentiment for BTC is cautiously optimistic.

**ETH: 0.0** — Ethereum's recent volatility and mixed technical signals suggest a hold position. While on-chain activity is strong, the market is still digesting recent moves by key figures like Vitalik Buterin.

**SOL: +0.6** — Solana's record in daily active users and its strengths in high-speed, low-cost transactions make it attractive. The network's growing adoption supports a positive outlook.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains a hold. The lack of strong directional indicators suggests maintaining current exposure.

**USDT: -0.3** — Given the potential for a rebound in risk assets like BTC and SOL, reducing exposure to USDT to allocate more capital to these assets seems prudent."
2024-08-30 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bullish signals emerging amidst recent volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a dip below $60K, influenced by regional trading dynamics, but large wallet accumulation suggests a potential bullish foundation. Ethereum's market activity is influenced by significant transactions from its co-founder, with ongoing debates about its network usage. Solana is showing strong network adoption with record daily active users and interest from memecoin activities, highlighting its competitive edge. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, with Dogecoin showing slight price decreases. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indices, suggesting a cautious but potentially opportunistic market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, large wallet accumulation and bullish on-chain signals suggest a potential rebound. The macroeconomic context supports a cautious increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from technical indicators and recent significant transactions by Vitalik Buterin create uncertainty. Hold current position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and positive news about daily active users and memecoin activity provide a bullish outlook. Consider increasing exposure to capitalize on growth potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining the current position without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish signals in other assets, consider reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2024-08-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has been trading within a narrow range, with significant accumulation by large wallets suggesting a potential bullish foundation despite current price weakness. Ethereum has seen some internal movements by its co-founder, which may have contributed to mild market reactions. Solana's network activity is on the rise, highlighted by a record surge in daily active users, which could indicate growing adoption and interest. In contrast, Dogecoin and Tether have not seen significant developments. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a relatively stable environment, although the recent dip in the S&P 500 may indicate some risk-off sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, the accumulation by large wallets suggests potential for a bullish reversal. However, the lack of immediate bullish technical signals warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent internal movements by a co-founder and no clear bullish technical indicators. The market remains indecisive, justifying a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network activity and user adoption provide a positive outlook, despite recent price declines. The ecosystem's growth potential supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral position is prudent given the current market conditions.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of the overall cautious market sentiment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is advisable to hedge against volatility, though not excessively given the potential for bullish reversals in other assets."
2024-08-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite some macroeconomic uncertainties, such as a relatively high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, the crypto market is showing signs of resilience. Bitcoin's recent accumulation by large wallets suggests a potential bullish foundation, while Ethereum's network activity and Solana's record daily active users highlight growing adoption. However, technical indicators remain mixed, with most assets showing no clear buy signals. The stablecoin USDT maintains its bullish momentum, indicating a continued preference for liquidity amidst these conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Recent accumulation by large wallets and a significant price increase suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, despite mixed technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — While technicals are mixed, the rebound in price and network activity provides a positive outlook, albeit with some caution due to recent sell-offs by key figures.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and a significant price increase suggest a bullish sentiment, supported by the recent surge in daily active users.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, despite its current bullish momentum."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility and fluctuations in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a dip below $60K, driven by U.S. session weakness, although large wallets continue to accumulate, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Ethereum has shown some recovery from recent lows, with notable on-chain activity, but faces mixed sentiment due to Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions. Solana is experiencing strong network adoption, highlighted by a record surge in daily active users and interest in Solana-native memecoins. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, with Dogecoin showing low on-chain activity. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, which could influence crypto market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, accumulation by large wallets indicates potential bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While there is mixed sentiment due to recent transactions by Vitalik Buterin, the rebound from recent lows and on-chain activity suggest a slight positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong network adoption and record daily active users, along with interest in Solana-native memecoins, support a more positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signals for allocation changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment in the crypto market and potential bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to rotate capital into more promising opportunities."
2024-08-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a tug-of-war between accumulation by large wallets and price dips below $60K, indicating potential bullish foundations despite short-term volatility. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with increased network activity, but recent large transactions by Vitalik Buterin have created some uncertainty. Solana is gaining traction with a record surge in daily active users, driven by its high-speed, low-cost advantages, particularly in the memecoin space. Dogecoin and Tether remain relatively stable with no significant news impacting their current status. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large wallets suggests a potential bullish outlook. The macro context supports a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While there is some uncertainty due to Vitalik's transactions, the rebound and increased network activity provide a cautiously optimistic view.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and user growth highlight Solana's potential, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive signals in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-30 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 15.0) and a moderate U.S. dollar index (DXY at 101.7). This suggests a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment for risk assets. Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range with significant accumulation by large holders, indicating potential bullish sentiment despite recent price dips. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals with notable on-chain activity and founder transactions, while Solana is seeing increased network adoption and user activity, which is positive for its outlook. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, with Dogecoin showing low on-chain activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders suggests a bullish foundation. The macro environment supports risk assets, making BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Mixed signals from founder transactions and on-chain activity, but overall network activity remains robust. Slightly positive outlook compared to other assets.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network adoption and daily active user growth, coupled with positive sentiment from memecoin activity, make Solana an attractive option in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance. No compelling reason to adjust exposure at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive sentiment for risk assets and accumulation in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 15.0) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a cautiously optimistic risk sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing a tug-of-war between buying interest from large holders and selling pressure during U.S. trading hours, indicating a potential bullish foundation despite recent dips. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with bullish momentum and network activity, though market reactions to co-founder transactions are mixed. Solana's network adoption is highlighted by record daily active users and memecoin activity, suggesting strong growth potential. Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, but DOGE shows technical strength with bullish momentum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, the accumulation by large holders and bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive momentum and network activity support a modest allocation increase, though cautious sentiment due to co-founder transactions tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong network growth and bullish momentum, coupled with positive news on user adoption, make Solana an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While lacking significant news, DOGE's technical indicators show bullish momentum, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally positive sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum with predictions of a potential surge to $100K by year-end, supported by strong on-chain activity. Ethereum also shows bullish momentum with expectations of a rebound to $4,000. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, although its technical indicators are mixed. Dogecoin is maintaining bullish momentum without significant news influences. USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market fluctuations. Overall, the market shows signs of optimism, with potential for growth in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment suggest further upside potential. Increased on-chain activity supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about potential price recovery to $4,000 make ETH attractive, though slightly less so than BTC due to lower on-chain activity.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, Solana's strong growth narrative and potential as a scalable payment solution provide a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum persists, but lack of significant news and lower transaction activity compared to other assets suggest a moderate positive stance.

USDT: -0.2 — As risk appetite increases, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-08-31 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility indicated by the VIX at 15.18 and a steady U.S. Dollar Index at 101.7. The crypto market shows a bullish sentiment, with Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibiting strong momentum and positive news forecasts suggesting significant potential upside. Bitcoin is predicted to surge towards $100K by year-end, while Ethereum is expected to rebound to $4,000. Solana continues to gain attention for its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. DOGE and USDT lack significant news, with DOGE showing consistent bullish momentum and USDT maintaining its role as a stablecoin amidst these market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news predicting a surge to $100K make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with optimistic news about a potential rebound to $4,000, support a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite a lack of buy signals, Solana's growth potential and bullish momentum warrant a moderate positive score.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, DOGE maintains bullish momentum, justifying a slight positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in the current bullish market, serving as a safe haven without significant allocation changes."
2024-08-31 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several major cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward momentum, supported by predictions of a potential surge toward $100K by year-end. Ethereum also shows bullish momentum, with expectations of a return to the $4,000 level. Solana continues to demonstrate robust growth and scalability, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms like PayPal. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and USDT remain relatively stable with no significant news impacting their outlook. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a cautiously bullish stance on risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news predicting a significant price surge. On-chain activity supports increased interest and engagement.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and technical indicators, coupled with optimistic price predictions, suggest a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and comparisons to major payment platforms highlight its potential for further growth.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the lack of significant news or developments keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation away from stablecoins is expected, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-31 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin shows potential for significant upside, with predictions of reaching $100K by year-end, supported by strong on-chain activity and technical indicators. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards $4,000, suggesting a positive outlook despite recent skepticism. Solana continues to gain attention for its scalability and growth potential, though its recent price movements have been relatively stable. Meanwhile, DOGE and USDT exhibit less volatility, with DOGE lacking significant news and USDT maintaining its role as a stablecoin amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and bullish news predicting a potential surge to $100K. On-chain activity supports this positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and news suggesting a rebound to $4,000 provide a favorable outlook, though slightly less strong than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued bullish momentum and positive sentiment around its scalability and growth potential, though recent price movements have been stable.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no strong signals to adjust the current position.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a potential for capital rotation out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-31 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is showing potential for a significant rally towards $100K by the end of the year, supported by strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards the $4,000 level, indicating a potential upward trend. Solana continues to demonstrate strong growth and scalability, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms like PayPal. Despite the positive outlook for these assets, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant changes in traditional financial indicators. The lack of significant news for DOGE and USDT suggests a neutral stance for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news sentiment suggest a potential rally. The macroeconomic context is stable, supporting risk-on behavior.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and news predicting a rebound to $4,000 provide a supportive backdrop for Ethereum, though slightly less compelling than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued strong growth and scalability potential make Solana an attractive asset, though recent price movements are less pronounced than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases with bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected."
2024-08-31 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, with key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum showing positive momentum and technical indicators. Bitcoin is being buoyed by predictions of a potential surge to $100K by year-end, while Ethereum is expected to rebound to $4,000. Solana is drawing attention due to its impressive growth and potential to rival traditional payment systems. Despite the bullish sentiment, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and steady interest rates, which supports a balanced approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment about a potential surge to $100K make Bitcoin an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent skepticism, Ethereum's potential rebound to $4,000 and consistent bullish technical indicators support a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's impressive growth and potential to rival major payment systems, along with strong technical indicators, justify a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold with no clear signal for increased or decreased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin shows potential for a significant rally, possibly reaching $100K by year-end, supported by strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards the $4,000 level, suggesting a favorable outlook. Solana continues to impress with its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. However, the macroeconomic context, including a relatively high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggests a mixed risk environment, which might lead to some capital preservation strategies involving USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment suggest a potential rally. The prediction of a surge to $100K provides a strong bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent skepticism, the expectation of a rebound to $4,000, along with bullish technical indicators, supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued growth and scalability potential, along with strong technical indicators, make Solana an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure without increasing or decreasing.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets with higher potential returns."
2024-08-31 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with technical indicators showing bullish momentum across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin's potential to reach $100K by year-end and Ethereum's expected rebound to $4,000 highlight a positive outlook, despite recent price declines. Solana's growth and scalability continue to attract attention, suggesting potential for further gains. However, DOGE lacks significant news or momentum, while USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and bullish news suggest potential for significant upside. The market sentiment is positive, and BTC's role as a market leader supports increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent price declines, bullish momentum and positive news about a potential rebound to $4,000 make ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment around Solana's scalability and growth, along with strong technical indicators, justify a moderate increase in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed momentum signals suggest maintaining current holdings without additional allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish market sentiment, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more capital into riskier assets like BTC and ETH is advisable."
2024-08-31 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower at 101.7, which could support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum show strong technical indicators with bullish momentum, supported by positive news suggesting potential price surges. Solana also displays robust growth potential, with discussions around its scalability and potential to rival major payment platforms. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, but DOGE shows stable technical signals. Overall, the market sentiment leans bullish for major cryptocurrencies, with a potential rotation away from stablecoins like USDT as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and bullish news suggesting a potential rally to $100K. On-chain activity is also supportive.

ETH: +0.7 — Positive momentum and news indicating a potential rebound to $4,000. Technical indicators remain bullish.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and positive sentiment around its scalability and growth potential, though slightly less strong than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Stable technical indicators with no significant news to drive price action. Maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shows bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-08-31 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by predictions of a potential rally to $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound, with analysts predicting a return to the $4,000 level. Solana continues to demonstrate significant growth and scalability, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. Despite the positive technical indicators, DOGE lacks significant news to drive its price, and USDT remains stable with no major developments.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about a potential rebound to $4,000 make ETH attractive. The technical indicators also support a buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and strong growth potential, as highlighted by comparisons to major payment platforms, suggest a favorable outlook for SOL.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite slight price increases, the lack of significant news or strong technical signals results in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's technical indicators show strong upward momentum, supported by predictions of a potential surge to $100K by year-end. Ethereum also displays bullish momentum, with expectations of a rebound to $4,000. Solana continues to capture attention due to its scalability and potential to rival traditional payment systems, although its recent price movement is mixed. Dogecoin and USDT remain relatively stable, with no significant news or drastic market changes affecting them. The macroeconomic context, including stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, suggests a conducive environment for risk-on investments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment with predictions of a significant rally. On-chain activity supports increased exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about potential price recovery to $4,000. Technical indicators are supportive.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a recent price decrease, Solana's long-term growth potential and positive sentiment about its scalability justify a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin is showing signs of strength with a potential rally towards $100K by year-end, supported by positive on-chain activity and technical indicators. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards $4,000, with bullish momentum signals supporting this outlook. Solana continues to demonstrate significant growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms due to its scalability. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, with Dogecoin showing stable but unspectacular performance. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a slightly risk-on environment, encouraging capital allocation towards growth assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news sentiment, suggesting potential for significant price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about potential price recovery to $4,000 make ETH attractive, though slightly less so than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued positive momentum and strong growth narrative, though lacking immediate technical buy signals compared to BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or technical changes; maintaining a neutral stance given the lack of clear directional signals.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to allocate more capital towards growth assets."
2024-08-31 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with predictions suggesting a potential rally towards $100K by year-end. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards the $4,000 level, indicating a positive outlook. Solana continues to gain attention due to its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms. However, Dogecoin lacks significant news, and its technical indicators show mixed signals. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment, which could favor cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment suggest a potential rally. Increased on-chain activity supports a higher allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and bullish news sentiment about a potential rebound to $4,000 justify an increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite a lack of a buy signal from trend indicators, Solana's growth potential and positive news coverage support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment leans towards risk-on, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of higher potential returns in other cryptocurrencies is advisable."
2024-08-31 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.18. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, suggesting a stable dollar, while gold prices are high, indicating a potential hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty. In the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum show strong technical signals with bullish momentum and positive news sentiment, suggesting potential for upward movement.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment about potential price surge to $100K. High on-chain activity supports increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about potential rebound to $4K. Consistent technical indicators support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite lacking strong technical buy signals, Solana's potential as a scalable platform akin to PayPal provides a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or strong technical indicators to suggest a change in allocation. Maintain current holdings.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in BTC and ETH."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing potential for significant upward movement, as indicated by both technical indicators and bullish news predictions. Bitcoin is maintaining bullish momentum, and analysts predict a potential surge toward $100K by the end of the year. Ethereum also shows strong technical signals with expectations of a rebound to $4,000. Solana is gaining attention due to its scalability and potential to rival major payment systems, though its technical indicators are mixed. Dogecoin lacks significant news and shows no clear momentum, while USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment suggest potential for substantial gains. The market is showing resilience despite recent fluctuations.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical indicators and optimistic news about a potential rebound to $4,000 support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, Solana's long-term growth potential and scalability news provide a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and potential for gains in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2024-08-31 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. dollar index remains stable, which typically supports risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum both exhibit strong technical indicators, with bullish momentum and positive news suggesting potential for significant price increases. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability, which could position it as a strong competitor in the payment space. Dogecoin lacks significant news and shows mixed technical signals, while USDT remains stable with consistent buy signals, indicating a steady demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news about potential price surge to $100K by year-end. On-chain activity supports bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent price decreases, strong buy signals and news suggesting a rebound to $4,000 provide a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Although lacking a buy signal, Solana's potential as a scalable payment solution and its significant growth since 2020 make it attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or strong technical indicators to suggest a directional bias. Maintain current holdings.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in BTC and ETH, there is an opportunity to rotate some capital out of USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-08-31 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and relatively low crude oil prices, suggesting a neutral backdrop for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit bullish momentum signals and positive news sentiment, with predictions of significant price increases by year-end. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability, potentially rivaling traditional payment systems, although its technical indicators remain neutral. Dogecoin and Tether have no significant news, and their market data suggest stability without clear directional signals. Overall, the market sentiment leans slightly bullish for major cryptocurrencies, while stablecoins like USDT may see reduced demand as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment regarding potential price surges to $100K make BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite recent technical weakness, the potential for a rebound to $4,000 and bullish news sentiment support a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, Solana's potential as a scalable payment solution and its impressive growth history warrant a modest positive score.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."
2024-08-31 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing potential for significant upward movement based on recent predictions and technical analyses. Bitcoin is being eyed for a potential surge to $100K by year-end, while Ethereum is anticipated to rebound to $4,000. Solana continues to be highlighted for its scalability and growth potential, drawing comparisons to major payment platforms like PayPal. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Tether lack significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable position. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility, with stable interest rates and commodity prices, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the long-term prediction of a surge to $100K and recent news support a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are not currently bullish, the potential for a rebound to $4,000 and increased on-chain activity warrant a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.4 — With its strong growth narrative and potential to rival major payment platforms, Solana remains attractive, despite current technical neutrality.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or technical changes suggest maintaining the current position without adjustment.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the optimistic outlook for BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential upside in risk assets."
2024-08-31 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which can be supportive of risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both under technical pressure, with no immediate buy signals from trend or momentum indicators. However, news suggests potential for significant upside in both BTC and ETH, with predictions of BTC reaching $100K and ETH returning to $4,000 by year-end. Solana continues to show strong growth potential, being compared to major payment platforms like PayPal. DOGE and USDT lack significant news, but DOGE shows some technical strength with a buy signal from its short-term moving average.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite current technical weakness, the news of a potential rally to $100K provides a strong bullish sentiment. On-chain activity also shows increased transactions, suggesting growing interest.

ETH: +0.3 — Although technical indicators are weak, news of a potential rebound to $4,000 supports a moderate bullish stance. The asset remains attractive for potential upside.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's growth narrative and comparison to PayPal suggest strong long-term potential. Despite current technical weakness, the asset remains appealing for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and lack of significant news result in a neutral stance. No compelling reason to increase or decrease exposure at this time.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish developments in other cryptocurrencies, there is a case for reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on risk asset opportunities."
2024-08-31 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin shows potential for a significant rally towards $100K by year-end, supported by positive news and a recent recovery from a dip. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards $4,000, although current technical indicators are not yet bullish. Solana's growth is noteworthy, with discussions about its potential to rival major payment systems, indicating strong long-term prospects. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, but DOGE shows some technical strength, while USDT remains a safe haven amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite no immediate technical buy signals, the positive long-term outlook and potential for a year-end rally support a moderately bullish stance.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, the potential for a rebound to $4,000 provides a positive outlook, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Strong growth potential and discussions about scalability enhance its attractiveness, despite neutral technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — Technical indicators show some bullish momentum, and while news is lacking, the slight upward price trend justifies a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally optimistic outlook for other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly to allocate more towards growth-oriented cryptocurrencies is advisable."
2024-08-31 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a significant rally towards $100K by the end of the year, according to analysts. Ethereum is also expected to rebound towards the $4,000 level, indicating positive sentiment despite recent skepticism. Solana is gaining attention for its scalability and potential to rival major payment systems, suggesting strong growth prospects. However, technical indicators for most assets remain neutral, with no clear buy signals from short-term moving averages or momentum indicators. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk appetite, making USDT less attractive as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite neutral technical indicators, positive news sentiment and potential for a year-end rally support a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Anticipated rebound to $4,000 and stable macro conditions warrant a slight increase in allocation, though technicals remain neutral.

SOL: +0.4 — Strong growth narrative and scalability potential provide a supportive backdrop, despite lack of immediate technical buy signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies and stable macro conditions, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to increase exposure to riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which can be supportive for cryptocurrencies as they often benefit from a weaker dollar. Bitcoin and Ethereum have bullish long-term projections, with analysts predicting significant price increases by year-end. Solana continues to be viewed favorably for its scalability and growth potential, though it lacks immediate bullish technical signals. Dogecoin and USDT lack significant news, but DOGE shows a persistent buy signal in its short-term trend. Overall, the market sentiment leans towards cautious optimism, with potential for upward movement in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the long-term outlook remains strong with predictions of a significant price surge. This warrants a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum has a positive long-term forecast with potential to reach $4,000. However, current technicals are not supportive, suggesting a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's impressive growth and potential as a scalable platform support a modest buy signal, although immediate technical indicators are neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or strong technical signals suggest maintaining the current position without additional allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally optimistic outlook for cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to allocate more towards risk assets is prudent."
2024-09-01 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, suggesting a relatively stable dollar, which can impact crypto markets by affecting foreign investment flows. In the crypto market, there is no significant news impacting any of the major assets, and the technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE show a lack of strong bullish signals, with most assets trading within normal ranges. USDT shows a slight buy signal, indicating a preference for stability amidst uncertain market conditions. Overall, the market sentiment appears neutral with a slight inclination towards stability and caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin shows mixed signals with no strong momentum or trend indicators. The absence of significant news and normal on-chain activity suggests a hold position.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are neutral, with no significant news or on-chain activity changes. Maintain current exposure as there is no clear directional bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's price and volume are stable with no significant changes in technical indicators or news. Hold position as there is no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, with a slight buy signal but no supporting momentum. Hold position as the market lacks clear direction.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the neutral to slightly cautious market sentiment, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides stability. The technical buy signals for USDT support this cautious approach."
2024-09-01 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a lack of significant news and a generally bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators suggest a downward trend for most assets, with BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE all showing signs of weakness as they trade below key moving averages and exhibit bearish momentum signals. On-chain activity is relatively normal, but there is no strong bullish catalyst to drive prices higher. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a cautious market sentiment. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven, reflecting a preference for stability amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is experiencing bearish momentum with no significant news to support a reversal. The price is below key moving averages, indicating potential further downside.

ETH: -0.4 — ETH is showing signs of a possible breakdown, trading below the lower Bollinger Band with low on-chain activity. The lack of bullish signals suggests caution.

SOL: -0.5 — SOL has experienced a significant price decrease and is trading below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a bearish trend. No positive news or signals to counteract this.

DOGE: -0.2 — DOGE is also trading below the lower Bollinger Band with low transaction activity, suggesting a bearish outlook. However, the presence of a buy signal in the trend indicator tempers the score slightly.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, USDT is favored as a stable asset, providing a safe haven for capital preservation. The buy signal in the trend indicator supports maintaining or increasing exposure."
2024-09-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be cautiously bearish, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight declines in price over the past few hours. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of strong bullish momentum, with several assets trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a neutral to slightly risk-averse environment. In the absence of significant news events, the market seems to be driven primarily by technical and on-chain data.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is showing signs of a potential breakdown with prices below the lower Bollinger Band and a lack of bullish momentum. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — ETH is also trading below its lower Bollinger Band with no bullish momentum, suggesting further downside risk. A slight reduction is advisable to mitigate potential losses.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, SOL's technical indicators do not provide a clear buy signal. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate given the mixed signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE shows no significant changes in technical indicators or market sentiment. Holding the current position is recommended.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT is a defensive strategy to preserve capital and reduce overall portfolio risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower at 101.7, which generally supports risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, the recent market data for major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL indicates a bearish trend, with prices mostly declining and technical indicators showing no buy signals. On-chain activity is generally low, except for a recent surge in BTC transactions, which might suggest some underlying interest or repositioning. The absence of significant news across all assets suggests that the market is primarily driven by technical factors and broader macroeconomic conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent surge in transaction activity, BTC's technical indicators remain bearish with prices below the Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential downside risk.

ETH: -0.4 — ETH is trading below its lower Bollinger Band with no bullish signals, indicating potential further weakness. Low on-chain activity supports a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL has experienced a significant price decrease and is below its lower Bollinger Band, suggesting caution. However, normal on-chain activity provides some stability.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE shows no significant changes in technical indicators or on-chain activity, maintaining a neutral outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce exposure to potential downside risks."
2024-09-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with most assets experiencing slight to significant price decreases over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with several assets trading below their Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. On-chain activity is generally low or normal, with no significant news impacting any of the assets. In this context, the macroeconomic backdrop remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in traditional financial indicators like the S&P 500 or the U.S. Dollar Index. Given the lack of positive catalysts and the bearish technical signals, a cautious approach with a preference for stability and liquidity is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Persistent bearish technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure to mitigate potential downside risk.

ETH: -0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no bullish momentum and low activity, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a recent price decrease, SOL's normal on-chain activity and lack of significant news suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

DOGE: -0.1 — Slight price decrease and no bullish signals indicate a minor reduction in exposure, reflecting the overall bearish sentiment.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, aligning with a defensive capital preservation strategy."
2024-09-01 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious, with most major cryptocurrencies experiencing slight price declines over the past few hours, followed by minor recoveries. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD suggest a lack of bullish momentum across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, with several assets showing signs of potential breakdowns as they hover near or below their lower Bollinger Bands. On-chain activity for BTC and DOGE has shown some surges, which might indicate increased interest or volatility, but without significant news to drive sentiment, the market remains uncertain. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in traditional markets, suggests a lack of external pressure to drive significant capital shifts into or out of cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite some on-chain activity surges, BTC lacks strong technical support for a bullish outlook. The absence of significant news and a stable macro environment suggest holding the current position.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH shows no significant changes in technical indicators or market sentiment. With no news to drive movement, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure may be warranted to mitigate potential downside risk.

DOGE: -0.3 — DOGE's price breakdown signals and increased on-chain activity suggest potential volatility. Reducing exposure slightly could help manage risk in the absence of positive news.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the cautious market sentiment and lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-09-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, which is not excessively strong, potentially supporting risk assets. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies shows a lack of clear bullish signals across the board, with all major assets showing no buy signals from technical indicators and MACD remaining below the signal line. On-chain activity is mostly normal, with no significant news impacting the market sentiment for any of the assets. The overall sentiment appears cautious, with slight increases in prices in the last hour, but no strong upward momentum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a slight price increase in the last hour, BTC's technical indicators do not show a buy signal, and on-chain activity remains normal. The lack of significant news or bullish signals suggests a neutral stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no buy signals from technical indicators, and on-chain activity is low. Without significant news or momentum, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

SOL: -0.1 — SOL experienced a significant price decrease earlier, with no recovery signals. Although on-chain activity is normal, the lack of bullish indicators suggests a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — DOGE's price has been volatile, with a recent significant decrease and no buy signals. The lack of positive news and technical support warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, especially given the cautious market sentiment."
2024-09-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight price decreases over the last hour, following a period of minor fluctuations. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE show no clear buy signals, as short-term moving averages remain below longer-term ones and MACD indicators are below their signal lines. This suggests a lack of strong bullish momentum. On-chain activity is mostly normal, with occasional surges, but no significant news has been reported for any of the assets, which might contribute to the current lack of directional conviction. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, which could encourage a conservative approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite normal on-chain activity, technical indicators do not support a buy signal, and there is no significant news to drive a strong directional move. Maintain current exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical or momentum signals, and there is no news to influence the market. Hold existing position.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL has experienced a significant price decrease and remains below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE has shown some on-chain activity surges, but technical indicators remain weak. Maintain current holdings as there is no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility and allows for flexibility in future reallocation."
2024-09-01 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral risk sentiment in traditional markets. Cryptocurrency markets are displaying mixed signals, with no significant news driving sentiment for any major asset. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE show no clear buy signals, as short-term moving averages remain below long-term averages and MACD indicators are below signal lines. On-chain activity is generally normal, with occasional surges in transaction activity, particularly for DOGE. The lack of significant news or strong technical signals suggests a cautious approach, with a preference for maintaining liquidity in USDT given the absence of clear bullish trends.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite an increase in transaction activity, BTC lacks strong technical or momentum signals. The absence of significant news further supports a neutral stance.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH shows normal on-chain activity and no clear technical signals. Without significant news or bullish indicators, a hold position is appropriate.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL's price is showing signs of a potential breakdown, as indicated by its position below the lower Bollinger Band. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: -0.1 — Although DOGE has experienced surges in transaction activity, the technical indicators remain bearish. A slight reduction is warranted to manage risk.

USDT: +0.3 — With no strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides liquidity and flexibility in a neutral market environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets experiencing slight declines in price over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD signals are not showing any bullish trends, and there is no significant news to drive market sentiment in a positive direction. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a cautious market environment. In such conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in stable assets like USDT could be prudent to mitigate risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite an increase in on-chain activity, BTC's technical indicators remain bearish, and there is no significant news to drive a positive sentiment shift.

ETH: -0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no bullish technical signals and lacks supportive news, suggesting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.3 — SOL's price is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside risk, and no positive news to counteract this.

DOGE: -0.1 — DOGE shows increased on-chain activity but lacks any bullish technical indicators or news, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment with no strong bullish signals for other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital."
2024-09-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears neutral to slightly bearish, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight decreases in price over the past few hours. Technical indicators, such as moving averages and MACD, do not signal strong bullish momentum for any of the assets. There is no significant news influencing the market, and on-chain activity remains within normal ranges. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a cautious market environment. In such conditions, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a slight preference for stable assets like USDT could be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — BTC shows no strong technical signals or news catalysts. The market is stable, and on-chain activity is normal, suggesting a hold position.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH lacks significant momentum or news. The slight price increase in the last hour is not enough to warrant a change in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a recent price increase, SOL's technical indicators remain bearish. However, the significant price increase in the last hour indicates a potential for short-term gains, warranting a slight positive score.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE has experienced a slight increase in price and transaction activity, but without strong technical or news support, maintaining a neutral stance is advisable.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment and lack of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity in uncertain conditions."
2024-09-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a lack of significant bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets showing neutral to slightly bearish technical indicators. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, does not provide a strong impetus for risk-on behavior. The absence of significant news events for any of the cryptocurrencies suggests a period of consolidation, with no immediate catalysts for directional moves. Given these conditions, maintaining a cautious stance with a focus on capital preservation seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin shows no clear directional bias with neutral technical indicators and no significant news. Maintaining current exposure is advisable.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are also neutral, with no significant news to drive price action. Holding the current position is recommended.

SOL: +0.1 — While Solana has experienced a slight increase in price recently, the lack of strong technical signals or news suggests only a modest preference for increasing exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite an increase in on-chain activity, Dogecoin's technical indicators remain neutral. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

USDT: +0.3 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for capital preservation and liquidity."
2024-09-01 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly bearish, with all major cryptocurrencies showing no clear buy signals based on technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD. On-chain activity is generally normal, with occasional surges, but not enough to indicate a strong trend shift. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility as indicated by the VIX, suggests a lack of strong external pressures on the crypto market. The absence of significant news for any of the assets further supports a cautious approach, with no immediate catalysts for drastic price movements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite some on-chain activity surges, there are no strong technical or news-driven signals to suggest a significant price movement. Maintain current exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical signals or news developments. On-chain activity is stable, suggesting a hold position.

SOL: +0.2 — A slight increase in price and volume suggests mild interest, but without strong technical or news support, only a modest positive score is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some on-chain activity surges, the lack of significant news or technical signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a lack of significant bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, with all assets trading within normal price ranges and technical indicators not suggesting strong momentum in either direction. On-chain activity for Bitcoin and Ethereum shows some fluctuations but remains generally stable. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively low volatility index and stable U.S. dollar index, suggests a neutral to slightly cautious market sentiment. The absence of significant news for any of the assets further reinforces the lack of a strong directional bias.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite some fluctuations in on-chain activity, there is no clear trend or momentum signal to justify a change in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators and on-chain activity are stable, with no significant news to drive a change in sentiment.

SOL: +0.2 — Slight positive price movement and increased volume suggest a mild preference for allocation, though without strong supporting signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite increased on-chain activity, the lack of technical or news-driven momentum keeps the allocation neutral.

USDT: +0.3 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent to hedge against potential volatility."
2024-09-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, suggesting a stable dollar, while gold prices remain high, indicating some investor caution. The recent market data for cryptocurrencies shows a mixed picture with slight fluctuations in prices and no strong buy signals from technical indicators. Notably, Solana shows a bullish momentum signal, which might indicate a potential upward trend. On-chain activity is generally within normal ranges, with occasional surges in transaction activity for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, but without significant news to drive sentiment shifts. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious with no clear bullish or bearish trends across the major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite some fluctuations in price and on-chain activity, there are no strong technical or news-driven signals to justify a change in allocation. The market remains neutral.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum shows normal activity levels and no significant price movement or news, suggesting a hold position is appropriate given the lack of clear signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana exhibits a bullish momentum signal and a significant price increase in the last hour, suggesting a potential upward trend. This warrants a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some activity surges, there are no significant price movements or news to drive a change in allocation. The market sentiment remains neutral.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals across other assets and a stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a relatively higher exposure to USDT provides a safety net against potential volatility."
2024-09-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context indicates a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as evidenced by a VIX of 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 101.7, suggesting a stable dollar, while gold prices remain high, indicating a potential flight to safety. In the crypto market, there is no significant news impacting any of the major cryptocurrencies, and technical indicators show a lack of strong bullish signals across the board. BTC, ETH, and DOGE are experiencing slight price fluctuations with no clear directional trend, while SOL shows some bullish momentum. USDT remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, but its high allocation in the portfolio suggests a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a slight increase in price and on-chain activity, technical indicators do not support a strong buy signal. Maintain current exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Similar to BTC, ETH shows no strong technical signals or news-driven catalysts to justify a change in allocation. Hold current position.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and a recent price increase suggest a modest opportunity for gains. Consider a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in price or on-chain activity, and no news to drive sentiment. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals in other assets, maintain a slightly reduced exposure to USDT to allow for potential capital rotation into SOL."
2024-09-01 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower at 101.7, which can be supportive for cryptocurrencies as it may indicate a weaker dollar environment. Across the crypto market, technical indicators show a lack of strong buy signals, with most assets trading within normal ranges of their Bollinger Bands and exhibiting mixed momentum signals. On-chain activity for BTC and ETH shows some fluctuations, with ETH experiencing a surge in transaction activity. SOL is showing some bullish momentum, while DOGE remains relatively stable with no significant news or technical changes. Overall, the market sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, with no significant news driving strong directional moves.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a recent surge in on-chain activity, BTC lacks clear upward momentum, and technical indicators do not suggest a strong buy signal. Holding is prudent given the stable macro environment.

ETH: +0.2 — ETH shows consistent on-chain activity surges, which is positive, but technical indicators remain mixed. A slight preference for ETH is justified due to its active network usage.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL exhibits bullish momentum and a significant price increase in the past hours. The positive technical indicators suggest a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE shows no significant changes in technical or on-chain data, maintaining a neutral stance as there are no compelling reasons to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the slightly positive sentiment in the broader crypto market, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets like SOL and ETH could be beneficial."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with a moderate U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in broader markets. In the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum show mixed signals with no significant news driving sentiment, while Solana exhibits bullish momentum with significant price increases. Dogecoin remains stable with no major developments, and USDT continues to serve as a stable anchor with no directional signals. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing potential for upward movement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, Bitcoin's recent price increase and activity surge indicate potential for further gains, albeit cautiously.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum shows bullish momentum with increased on-chain activity, suggesting a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and significant price increases make Solana the most attractive for capital allocation at this time.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in technicals or sentiment; maintain current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-09-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit some bullish momentum, indicated by their MACD signals, despite the lack of significant news. Solana shows the strongest technical signals, with both trend and momentum indicators suggesting a buy, supported by a recent price increase. Dogecoin, while experiencing a slight price increase, lacks strong technical support. The macroeconomic backdrop, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a moderate risk environment, which may encourage some capital rotation from stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the absence of significant news, BTC shows bullish momentum and a slight price increase, suggesting a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and slight price increase warrant a modest increase in allocation, although the absence of news keeps the score conservative.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators, including a buy signal and bullish momentum, along with a significant price increase, make Solana the most attractive asset currently.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is a slight price increase, the lack of bullish technical signals and significant news keeps the allocation neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the moderate risk environment and the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified."
2024-09-01 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish momentum in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, as indicated by their MACD signals. However, the absence of significant news and the lack of strong buy signals from trend indicators suggest a cautious approach. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, indicates a neutral to slightly positive risk environment. The U.S. Dollar Index is stable, and the S&P 500 is performing well, which could support risk assets. However, the overall market lacks strong directional catalysts, and the recent price movements have been relatively muted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of a strong trend signal, BTC shows bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a moderate preference for holding or slightly increasing exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — ETH has consistent bullish momentum and a recent buy signal from the short-term MA, making it relatively more attractive compared to other assets.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL shows a buy signal from the short-term MA and bullish momentum, indicating a favorable environment for increasing exposure, especially given its recent price stability.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE shows some bullish momentum, the lack of a strong trend signal and significant news keeps it neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — In the absence of strong bearish signals in other assets, it may be prudent to slightly reduce USDT holdings to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets like ETH and SOL."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals, despite the lack of significant news events. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) maintain bullish momentum, although BTC's on-chain activity is relatively low. Solana (SOL) is showing strong buy signals with consistent bullish momentum, supported by positive volume trends. Dogecoin (DOGE) has mixed signals with some bullish momentum but lacks a clear trend signal. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no significant changes in key indicators such as interest rates and volatility, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk appetite. USDT remains stable, but with buy signals indicating potential capital inflow as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite low on-chain activity, BTC maintains bullish momentum, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.5 — ETH shows consistent bullish momentum and activity surges, indicating a favorable environment for increased exposure.

SOL: +0.8 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with significant volume, make SOL the most attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with no clear trend direction; maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — With a slightly bullish market sentiment, reducing USDT exposure to allocate more capital to other assets is advisable."
2024-09-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, as evidenced by significant price decreases across major cryptocurrencies in the last hour, with BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE all experiencing notable declines. This is coupled with a breakdown below the lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential further downside. Despite some earlier bullish momentum signals, the recent sharp declines suggest caution. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment, with moderate volatility and no significant news impacting the crypto market today. In such conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT might be prudent to mitigate risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent significant price drop and breakdown below Bollinger Bands suggest a bearish outlook. Reducing exposure is advisable given the current market conditions.

ETH: -0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH has experienced a sharp decline and is below the lower Bollinger Band. Reducing exposure is recommended to manage downside risk.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop, SOL maintains a buy signal on the trend indicator. Holding current levels is appropriate as it might recover faster than others.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant price decrease and lack of bullish signals warrant a reduction in exposure to manage potential further losses.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and preserves capital, awaiting clearer bullish signals in other assets."
2024-09-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant price declines recently, breaking below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. However, both assets exhibit some bullish momentum signals, suggesting possible recovery. Solana has shown resilience with consistent buy signals, although it also experienced a price drop. Dogecoin's activity has surged, but it remains in a bearish trend. USDT remains stable, with a slight bullish momentum, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a cautious market outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish momentum, Bitcoin's recent price breakdown and lack of significant news support a cautious stance. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's price breakdown and lack of bullish signals warrant a slight reduction in exposure, despite its previous bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consistent buy signals and resilience in the face of broader market declines suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite increased on-chain activity, Dogecoin's bearish trend and lack of significant news maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the overall market volatility and bearish signals in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT is advisable for risk management."
2024-09-02 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bearish indicators but potential for bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight uptick amid a generally bearish start to September, with macroeconomic data potentially providing support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts, which could weigh on sentiment. Solana has no significant news, but technical indicators suggest potential buying interest. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no significant news, but its role as a safe haven may be less attractive if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price decreases, potential macroeconomic support and bullish momentum indicators suggest a cautious buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty and mixed technical signals warrant a neutral stance, balancing potential risks and opportunities.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and lack of negative news support a moderate buy signal, suggesting potential for upward movement.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent declines and bearish sentiment justify reducing exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — While stable, potential capital rotation into more volatile assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing seasonal bearishness, with significant outflows from U.S. ETFs, although upcoming U.S. economic data could potentially provide support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan, which could weigh on its price. Solana, despite lacking significant news, shows some technical strength with buy signals from moving averages. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting broader market sentiment. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — While BTC is under seasonal bearish pressure, potential macroeconomic developments could provide support. Maintain a cautious positive stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite the lack of news, SOL's technical indicators are positive, suggesting potential for upward movement.

DOGE: -0.2 — With DOGE among the top decliners and no bullish signals, it's prudent to reduce exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable for stability."
2024-09-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent price movements and technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a seasonally bearish period, with ETF outflows contributing to a lack of strong upward momentum. However, potential macroeconomic developments, such as U.S. manufacturing and jobs data, could weaken the dollar and provide support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions against its use in FTX creditor distributions, which may weigh on its performance. Solana has no significant news, but its technical indicators show a lack of bullish momentum. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting negative sentiment. Tether remains stable, with no significant news, but its technical indicators suggest a potential breakdown.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the bearish seasonal trend and ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic developments could support Bitcoin, making it relatively attractive compared to other assets.

ETH: -0.2 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding its use in FTX creditor distributions creates a negative sentiment, despite stable technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest a hold position, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — As one of the top decliners with negative sentiment, reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish market conditions.

USDT: +0.2 — In a cautious market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to hedge against volatility and potential downturns in other assets."
2024-09-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish undertone, as indicated by the recent price movements and technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a mild uptick, but the outflows from U.S. ETFs suggest a lack of strong investor confidence. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges, which could weigh on its price. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news, but Dogecoin is noted as a top decliner, reflecting a bearish sentiment. Tether remains stable with no significant news, but its technical indicators suggest a potential breakdown, indicating a cautious approach to stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the ETF outflows, Bitcoin's potential support from weakening U.S. economic data and its slight price increase suggest a cautious buy signal.

ETH: -0.2 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts in Ethereum create uncertainty, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana remains a hold as there is no clear directional signal.

DOGE: -0.3 — As one of the top decliners and with bearish market sentiment, reducing exposure to Dogecoin seems prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market environment and potential breakdown signals, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-09-02 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a mix of slight price fluctuations and bearish undertones. Bitcoin is experiencing seasonal bearishness, though potential macroeconomic developments could provide support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainties with the SEC's potential intervention in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting broader market bearishness. There is no significant news for Solana and Tether, but the technical indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum across most assets. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly cautious risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite the seasonal bearish trend, potential macroeconomic support and a high level of on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal.

**SOL: 0.0** — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, maintaining the current position seems prudent.

**DOGE: -0.3** — Significant recent price decline and bearish sentiment warrant a reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

**USDT: +0.1** — Given the cautious market sentiment, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin exposure for liquidity and safety is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with slight upward movements in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, despite a generally bearish start to September. Bitcoin's price is hovering around $58,500, with potential macroeconomic factors such as U.S. manufacturing and jobs data possibly providing support. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact sentiment. Dogecoin has been among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, which may encourage some risk-taking but also highlights the importance of cautious allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the bearish start to September, potential macroeconomic support and a slight uptick in price suggest a moderate buy signal. The market is waiting for macro data that could weaken the dollar, benefiting BTC.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts in ETH create uncertainty, offsetting any potential gains from broader market movements. Neutral stance due to mixed signals.

SOL: +0.2 — No significant news, but recent price increases and stable on-chain activity suggest a slight positive bias. The market is relatively stable, and SOL could benefit from any broader crypto market recovery.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent declines and negative sentiment position DOGE as less attractive. The lack of positive catalysts and its position as a top decliner suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the cautious market environment and potential for volatility, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against downside risks while allowing flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-09-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is slightly bearish, with Bitcoin starting September with a minor uptick but facing ETF outflows and a seasonally bearish outlook. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which could impact its use in FTX creditor distributions. Dogecoin is among the top decliners, reflecting a bearish sentiment at the start of the month. The macroeconomic context shows a stable U.S. dollar index and a relatively low volatility index, suggesting a cautious market environment. The lack of significant news for Solana and Tether indicates a neutral stance for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the ETF outflows, the potential weakening of the dollar could support Bitcoin. The on-chain activity surge also indicates strong interest.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts in ETH creates a cautious outlook, despite stable technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral position. The recent price fluctuations do not indicate a clear trend.

DOGE: -0.3 — Being among the top decliners and facing bearish sentiment, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted to mitigate potential losses.

USDT: +0.1 — Maintaining a slightly positive score as a hedge against market volatility, given the current bearish sentiment in other assets."
2024-09-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing some seasonal bearishness, with ETF outflows indicating reduced institutional interest, although potential macroeconomic developments could provide support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could weigh on sentiment. Solana and Tether lack significant news, while Dogecoin is underperforming, reflecting broader market bearishness. Overall, the macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic support and on-chain activity suggest moderate upside potential.

ETH: -0.3 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts creates downside risk, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

DOGE: -0.4 — Recent underperformance and bearish sentiment justify reducing exposure to Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.4 — In a mixed and slightly bearish market environment, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-09-02 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum despite a generally bearish macroeconomic backdrop. Bitcoin's price has been relatively stable with a slight uptick, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the dollar. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's potential intervention in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which could impact its short-term outlook. Solana and Dogecoin have shown significant price increases in the last few hours, but Dogecoin's recent decline highlights its volatility. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows bullish momentum and potential support from macroeconomic factors, making it relatively attractive despite ETF outflows.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts creates a mixed outlook, balancing recent price gains.

SOL: +0.3 — Significant price increase and normal on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though lacking strong news support.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price increases are overshadowed by previous declines and low on-chain activity, warranting a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.2 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is justified."
2024-09-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin's price has stabilized around $58,500, despite recent ETF outflows, and could benefit from upcoming U.S. economic data. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts, which may weigh on its performance. Solana and Dogecoin show mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin experiencing a recent decline. Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum and potential macroeconomic support suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite ETF outflows.

ETH: +0.2 — Bullish momentum is present, but regulatory concerns regarding the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts introduce some uncertainty.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's recent price increases and bullish momentum signal a moderate buy opportunity.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent price decline and low activity suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of bullish momentum, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets."
2024-09-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and slight price increases over the past few hours. Bitcoin is experiencing upward momentum, supported by potential macroeconomic developments that could weaken the U.S. dollar, although ETF outflows present a concern. Ethereum is also showing bullish momentum, but potential regulatory challenges from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts could create headwinds. Solana and Dogecoin have seen price increases, but Dogecoin's recent decline in market sentiment suggests caution. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst these dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support, despite ETF outflows. The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is tempered by potential regulatory challenges, but the technicals remain positive.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's price increase and bullish momentum signal provide a moderate buy signal, although lacking significant news support.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite recent price increases, Dogecoin's market sentiment has turned bearish, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets and a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, some capital rotation out of USDT is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential support from macroeconomic developments, such as anticipated U.S. data that could weaken the dollar. Despite this, Bitcoin ETFs have experienced outflows, indicating some investor caution. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which may impact its use in specific financial contexts. Solana lacks significant news, but its technical indicators suggest bullish momentum. Dogecoin has been among the top decliners, reflecting bearish sentiment. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's potential support from macroeconomic factors and bullish momentum signals suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainties from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts create a neutral stance despite bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — Continued bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal, despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price declines and bearish sentiment warrant a reduction in exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience amid a seasonally bearish start to September. Despite ETF outflows, potential macroeconomic developments could provide support for BTC. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could weigh on its sentiment. Solana lacks significant news, but its technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline, reflecting broader market bearishness. USDT remains stable, but its technical indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum, indicating a potential shift in capital allocation towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, BTC's technical indicators remain strong, and potential macroeconomic support could drive positive momentum.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC create uncertainty, balancing out the otherwise bullish technical indicators.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed technical signals with no significant news, but the slight positive momentum suggests a cautious buy.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price decline and bearish sentiment warrant a slight reduction in exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a slightly reduced exposure to stablecoins is prudent."
2024-09-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of resilience despite recent ETF outflows and a traditionally bearish September start. The potential weakening of the U.S. dollar could provide additional support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC intervention in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which could impact its short-term attractiveness. Solana and Dogecoin have shown recent price increases, with Solana benefiting from strong momentum signals. Dogecoin, however, remains under pressure from broader market sentiment. USDT remains stable, but with no significant bullish signals, it may see reduced allocation as risk appetite grows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and potential macroeconomic support from a weaker dollar could drive further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from the SEC's stance on FTX creditor payouts tempers bullish technical signals, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong momentum and recent price increase suggest positive sentiment, making it an attractive allocation in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.1 — While recent price increases are noted, broader bearish sentiment and its position as a top decliner suggest caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With a potential increase in risk appetite and no bullish signals, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-09-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight uptick despite bearish seasonal trends, with potential macroeconomic developments that could provide support. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to the SEC's stance on its use in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which may dampen investor confidence. Solana shows positive technical signals but lacks significant news catalysts. Dogecoin is underperforming relative to other assets, reflecting a bearish sentiment. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite seasonal bearish trends, BTC's technical indicators are strong, and potential macroeconomic support could enhance its attractiveness.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC create uncertainty, offsetting its bullish technical signals and leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and recent price gains suggest positive momentum, making it an attractive allocation despite the lack of news.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent underperformance and bearish sentiment warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the potential for positive movement in BTC and SOL, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital into these assets is advisable."
2024-09-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential support from upcoming U.S. macroeconomic data, despite recent ETF outflows. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC intervention, which could dampen its appeal. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing typical market fluctuations without significant news catalysts, though Dogecoin is noted as a top decliner, reflecting bearish sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a slightly weaker dollar, suggests a mixed environment where risk assets might see moderate support, but caution is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain bullish, and potential macroeconomic support could provide upward momentum.

ETH: -0.3 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts in ETH introduce uncertainty, overshadowing its technical strength.

SOL: +0.3 — Solid technical indicators and lack of negative news suggest a moderate buy signal, though no significant catalysts are present.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent declines and bearish sentiment warrant a cautious approach, though technicals are not strongly negative.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed market signals, maintaining a neutral position in USDT allows flexibility to respond to market developments."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators over the past few hours. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight uptick in price despite recent ETF outflows, and potential macroeconomic developments could further support its price. Ethereum faces potential regulatory challenges from the SEC, which may impact its use in certain financial operations. Solana and Dogecoin are showing strong technical signals, but Dogecoin's recent price decline highlights some bearish sentiment. USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, with bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support. Despite ETF outflows, the overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum shows bullish technical signals, the potential SEC challenge introduces uncertainty. However, the overall market momentum supports a slightly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana exhibits strong technical indicators and significant price increases, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite technical buy signals, recent price declines and bearish sentiment suggest a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-09-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential support from anticipated macroeconomic data that could weaken the U.S. dollar, despite recent ETF outflows. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions against FTX creditor payouts in ETH, which could weigh on its sentiment. Solana shows no significant news but maintains strong technical indicators, while Dogecoin is experiencing bearish sentiment as it lags behind Bitcoin. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain strong, and potential macroeconomic support could drive further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding FTX payouts create uncertainty, offsetting positive technical signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and no negative news make Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Bearish sentiment and underperformance relative to Bitcoin suggest reducing exposure, though current holdings limit the extent of reduction.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators despite some macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight upward trend, supported by potential macroeconomic factors that could weaken the U.S. dollar, although ETF outflows present a concern. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainties with the SEC potentially challenging its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan, which could dampen sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing mixed signals, with Solana lacking significant news and Dogecoin facing bearish sentiment. The stablecoin USDT remains neutral, as expected, with no significant market-moving news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with bullish momentum and potential macroeconomic support, despite ETF outflows. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

ETH: -0.1 — Regulatory concerns from the SEC regarding its use in FTX's bankruptcy plan create uncertainty, offsetting bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana maintains positive technical indicators, suggesting a modestly favorable outlook.

DOGE: -0.2 — Bearish sentiment and recent price declines suggest caution, despite technical indicators showing bullish momentum.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes in market conditions or sentiment, USDT remains a neutral hold, providing stability amid market fluctuations."
2024-09-02 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience amid a seasonally bearish start to September. Positive macroeconomic expectations, such as potential weakening of the U.S. dollar, could provide further support for Bitcoin. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which might affect its appeal. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit strong bullish momentum in recent price movements, although Dogecoin has been identified as a top decliner recently. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and potential macroeconomic support, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, regulatory uncertainty from the SEC regarding FTX creditor payouts in ETH tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Significant price increase and consistent bullish momentum make Solana an appealing choice for increased exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price increase is overshadowed by its status as a top decliner, suggesting caution in increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets and potential macroeconomic support, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on risk assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and positive short-term price trends. Bitcoin is trading around $58,500, with potential macroeconomic developments that could support its price. Ethereum faces some regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could impact its use in certain financial transactions. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing typical market fluctuations, with Dogecoin noted as a recent underperformer. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid these market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and potential macroeconomic support, making it an attractive allocation despite ETF outflows.

ETH: +0.2 — Although facing regulatory uncertainty, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a cautious positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's consistent bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent underperformance, Dogecoin's technical indicators are still positive, suggesting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals across other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-02 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a bullish bias, as indicated by the upward momentum and positive technical signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is showing strong technical indicators with a potential macroeconomic boost from weakening dollar expectations. Ethereum faces regulatory uncertainty due to potential SEC actions, which could dampen its outlook despite positive technical signals. Solana and Dogecoin are both experiencing positive momentum, but Dogecoin's recent decline and low on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach. USDT remains stable with no significant bullish signals, suggesting a lower preference for holding stablecoins in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and potential macroeconomic support from a weakening dollar make BTC attractive. Despite ETF outflows, the overall sentiment remains bullish.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive technical signals are overshadowed by regulatory concerns from the SEC. A cautious but slightly positive stance is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and technical signals, with no negative news, make SOL a favorable asset in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite technical buy signals, recent price declines and low on-chain activity suggest caution. Maintain a neutral to slightly negative stance given current holdings.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-09-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are positive, potential regulatory challenges from the SEC create uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and stable market activity make Solana an attractive option in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent bearish sentiment and underperformance relative to other assets suggest reducing exposure, though current holdings are minimal.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish market sentiment, there is a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-09-03 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite a recent dip in Bitcoin's price linked to broader market weakness and inflation concerns, institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains strong, potentially supporting future inflows. Ethereum is witnessing whale accumulation, suggesting confidence in its long-term prospects, although it faces technical resistance. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience, outperforming despite significant outflows, and maintains a strong narrative around decentralization. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed, with legal clarity providing some relief, but community interest is shifting towards new opportunities. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for recovery and growth.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and technical patterns indicate a possible breakout, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Strong performance and positive sentiment around decentralization support a favorable outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential growth opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive momentum and trend signals. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by institutional interest in BTC ETFs, despite recent price dips linked to broader market conditions. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, with whale accumulation indicating confidence among large holders. Solana continues to perform well, maintaining strong technical signals and defending its decentralization narrative. Dogecoin has seen some legal clarity with a lawsuit dismissal, but sentiment remains mixed with some community members looking for alternative investments. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest in BTC ETFs provide a bullish outlook, despite recent price dips. On-chain activity is also increasing.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and technical indicators suggest a potential breakout, making ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and strong performance despite outflows indicate continued investor confidence.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal clarity but community interest in alternatives; no strong signals for capital allocation changes.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment turns cautiously bullish, some capital can be rotated out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-09-03 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite recent macroeconomic concerns such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks, the crypto market shows resilience, supported by institutional interest in BTC ETFs and technical patterns suggesting potential breakouts for ETH. Solana's strong performance amid decentralization debates and DOGE's legal victory contribute positively to their respective sentiments. However, the stablecoin USDT remains relatively neutral, with no significant news or market signals indicating a shift in its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum and institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggest a favorable outlook, despite recent price dips linked to broader market conditions.

ETH: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and potential breakout from a technical pattern provide a bullish outlook, although recent seller pressure warrants cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong performance and positive sentiment around decentralization efforts support a bullish stance, despite past outflows.

DOGE: +0.2 — Legal dismissal of manipulation claims and community interest in new ICOs provide a slight positive sentiment, though overall market conditions remain cautious.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets."
2024-09-03 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most cryptocurrencies despite recent price fluctuations. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, particularly in the context of potential ETF inflows, although it faces pressure from broader market volatility and inflation concerns. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical pattern, supported by whale accumulation. Solana maintains a robust performance despite past large outflows, with ongoing discussions about its decentralization. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed, with legal challenges dismissed but community interest shifting towards new opportunities. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and bullish momentum signals suggest potential for recovery and growth.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by large holders and technical patterns indicate potential for an upward breakout, though recent sell pressure warrants caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued positive performance and strong technical indicators, along with reassurances about decentralization, support a favorable outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance, with no strong catalysts for movement.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-03 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite a recent dip in BTC prices linked to broader market pressures, institutional sentiment remains positive due to potential ETF inflows. Ethereum is showing signs of accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential upward movement. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and strong performance despite some large outflows. Dogecoin has seen increased on-chain activity, possibly influenced by community interest in new opportunities. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk appetite, although the high gold price indicates some investor caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, bullish momentum and positive ETF news suggest potential for recovery. Institutional interest remains a strong long-term driver.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential breakout from a technical pattern provide a positive outlook, though recent sell pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance and resilience despite outflows, along with positive sentiment from decentralization discussions, support a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased on-chain activity and community engagement around new opportunities provide a mild positive signal, though overall sentiment remains cautious.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-09-03 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin's price has been affected by these broader market conditions, although institutional interest remains strong with potential inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum shows signs of potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, supported by whale accumulation. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience despite large outflows, with its decentralization efforts being defended. Dogecoin's sentiment is slightly negative, with community interest shifting towards new opportunities amid legal dismissals. USDT remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite the recent price dip, BTC maintains a strong buy signal with bullish momentum and institutional interest, suggesting potential for recovery.

**ETH: +0.3** — While technicals indicate a possible breakout, mixed momentum signals and whale accumulation provide a moderate positive outlook.

**SOL: +0.6** — Strong technical indicators and resilience despite outflows make SOL an attractive option, supported by positive sentiment around its decentralization efforts.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant positive momentum or news, DOGE remains neutral as community interest shifts to other opportunities.

**USDT: -0.3** — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-09-03 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish indicators for certain assets but also signs of caution due to macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin has experienced a dip below $58k, influenced by broader market weakness and inflation concerns, yet institutional interest remains strong, particularly in the context of potential BTC ETFs. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, though technical indicators suggest potential volatility. Solana continues to show resilience despite large outflows, supported by its decentralized network narrative. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, though community interest in new ICOs indicates some speculative activity. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, institutional interest and bullish ETF news provide a supportive backdrop. On-chain activity remains strong, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and technical patterns hint at a possible breakout, though caution is warranted due to current seller pressure.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance despite outflows and positive news on decentralization support a bullish outlook. The asset's resilience and technical indicators are favorable.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with no clear directional bias. While legal issues are resolved, community speculation around new ICOs does not significantly alter the risk profile.

USDT: -0.3 — With some bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential upward movements in the market."
2024-09-03 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bullish signals for certain cryptocurrencies despite recent price fluctuations. Bitcoin has experienced a slight dip, influenced by broader market conditions such as rising inflation and stock market weakness, yet institutional interest remains strong with potential ETF inflows. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical pattern, supported by whale accumulation, though it faces seller pressure. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and growth despite large outflows, bolstered by its decentralization narrative. Dogecoin's sentiment is slightly bearish, with legal news providing some relief but not enough to drive significant upward momentum. Tether remains stable without significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and bullish ETF projections support a moderate buy signal. On-chain activity also shows increased transactions, indicating continued interest.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and potential technical breakout suggest a cautious buy. However, mixed momentum signals and seller pressure warrant a conservative approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and positive sentiment from decentralization efforts make SOL attractive. Its resilience despite outflows further supports a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While legal news provides some relief, overall sentiment remains bearish with no strong catalysts for upward movement. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish opportunities in other assets, reducing USDT exposure slightly to capitalize on riskier assets seems prudent, though maintaining a stable base is wise given market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with slight bearish tendencies due to macroeconomic factors such as rising inflation pressures and a dip in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has experienced a decline below $58k, influenced by these broader market conditions, but institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a long-term bullish factor. Ethereum is facing technical pressure but shows potential for a breakout, with whale accumulation indicating confidence at current levels. Solana continues to perform well despite significant outflows, supported by its decentralized network structure. Dogecoin is experiencing heightened on-chain activity and community interest, although sentiment remains cautious. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, institutional interest in BTC ETFs provides a supportive long-term outlook. However, current macroeconomic pressures warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation and potential technical breakout suggest a cautiously optimistic stance, though current price levels are under pressure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong performance despite outflows and positive news on decentralization support a favorable allocation, indicating resilience and growth potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased on-chain activity and community interest are balanced by cautious sentiment, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With mixed market conditions and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-09-03 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent dips linked to macroeconomic concerns such as rising inflation and stock market volatility. Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs remains strong, suggesting potential long-term inflows. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating confidence at current price levels, although technical indicators suggest potential near-term volatility. Solana continues to show strength despite large outflows, supported by its decentralized network narrative. Dogecoin remains stable, with legal clarity potentially reducing speculative pressure. USDT remains a safe haven amidst these dynamics, but lacks significant news or momentum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong institutional interest and positive technical signals suggest potential for recovery and growth.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout provide a cautiously optimistic outlook, though volatility is expected.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong performance and positive sentiment around decentralization support continued growth, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal clarity provides stability, but mixed sentiment and lack of strong catalysts suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — While it remains a stable asset, the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL reduces its relative attractiveness."
2024-09-03 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and underlying bearish pressures. Bitcoin has experienced a dip below $58k, influenced by broader market concerns such as rising inflation and stock market weakness. However, institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs remains a positive long-term factor. Ethereum is showing signs of potential breakout from a technical wedge pattern, with whale accumulation suggesting confidence in the asset's future performance. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience and growth despite large outflows, supported by its decentralized network narrative. Dogecoin, while facing bearish sentiment, has seen legal relief with the dismissal of a manipulation lawsuit, which could stabilize its outlook. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively high volatility index, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets, with a potential preference for stablecoins like USDT in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional interest in BTC ETFs and a consistent buy signal from trend indicators suggest a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation and technical patterns indicate potential for a breakout, though current price action remains subdued.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong historical performance and positive sentiment from decentralization efforts support a favorable view, despite recent price fluctuations.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal developments provide some stability, but overall sentiment remains mixed with no strong directional signals.

USDT: -0.2 — While macro conditions suggest some caution, the overall market environment and potential for risk-on behavior reduce the need for high stablecoin exposure."
2024-09-03 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some bullish signals emerging despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has shown resilience, maintaining a buy signal from its trend indicators, although its momentum remains subdued. Institutional interest in BTC ETFs suggests potential long-term inflows, which could support prices. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating confidence at current levels, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout. Solana continues to perform well, driven by strong on-chain activity and a robust defense of its decentralization. Dogecoin has seen a slight uptick in momentum, bolstered by positive legal news and community interest in new projects. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and a relatively strong S&P 500, supports a cautious risk-on approach, though the elevated VIX suggests lingering market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent market dips, the trend indicators remain positive, and institutional interest in ETFs provides a supportive backdrop for potential gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and technical patterns suggest a potential breakout, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and a positive narrative around decentralization make SOL an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent legal victories and community engagement provide a slight boost to sentiment, though caution is advised given the speculative nature of DOGE.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market outlook, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to allocate more capital to assets with growth potential."

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by a significant dip in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, which is linked to broader market weakness and rising inflation concerns. Despite this, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with projections of substantial inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential support around current levels, although technical indicators show pressure. Solana has shown resilience despite large outflows, supported by positive news on decentralization. Dogecoin has faced bearish sentiment, but legal clarity and community interest in new opportunities provide some support. USDT remains stable with no significant news, but its role as a safe haven becomes more prominent in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, institutional interest and ETF projections provide a bullish long-term outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale accumulation and technical pressure; holding current position as potential breakout looms.

SOL: +0.2 — Resilience amid outflows and positive decentralization news support a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Legal clarity and community interest balance bearish sentiment; no change in allocation is warranted.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining higher USDT exposure as a safe haven is prudent."
2024-09-03 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. This downturn is largely attributed to broader market weaknesses linked to U.S. stock market dips and inflation concerns. Despite this, there are some long-term bullish signals, such as institutional interest in BTC ETFs and whale accumulation in ETH. However, technical indicators for most assets suggest potential breakdowns, with prices falling below key support levels and Bollinger Bands indicating possible further declines. The macroeconomic environment, with elevated volatility and inflation concerns, suggests a cautious approach with a preference for stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and bearish technical signals outweigh the long-term bullish ETF outlook. Current market conditions suggest caution.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite whale accumulation, ETH is experiencing significant downward pressure and technical breakdowns, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.1 — SOL has shown resilience in the past, but current market conditions and technical indicators suggest potential further declines.

DOGE: -0.4 — Despite the dismissal of a manipulation lawsuit, DOGE is under bearish pressure with significant price drops and no strong positive catalysts.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk."
2024-09-03 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. This downturn is largely attributed to broader market dips linked to U.S. stock market weakness and inflation concerns. Despite this, there are pockets of optimism, such as institutional interest in BTC ETFs and whale accumulation in ETH, suggesting potential long-term bullish scenarios. However, technical indicators for most assets are showing breakdowns, indicating caution in the short term. DOGE has seen a slight uptick in activity, but sentiment remains bearish, while USDT remains stable with no significant news impacting its position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite long-term bullish ETF news, the current market slump and technical breakdowns suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.1 — Whale accumulation is a positive sign, but technicals indicate potential further downside. Maintain a cautious stance.

SOL: 0.0 — While SOL has shown resilience in the past, current technical breakdowns and market sentiment warrant a neutral position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent legal news and community interest in new ICOs have not significantly shifted sentiment. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital."
2024-09-03 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential support around current levels. Solana's performance has been resilient despite large outflows, and the network's decentralization remains a focal point. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, but a recent lawsuit dismissal and community interest in new ICOs provide some positive news. In such a bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT may be prudent to mitigate risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional bullishness, the current market dip and technical breakdown suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.2 — While whale accumulation offers some support, the bearish technicals and market sentiment warrant a cautious stance. Slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's resilience and decentralization defense are positives, but current price trends and market conditions suggest holding steady.

DOGE: -0.1 — The dismissal of the manipulation lawsuit is positive, but overall bearish sentiment and price trends suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and mitigates risk."
2024-09-03 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by broader market dips and inflation concerns. Despite the downturn, institutional interest in BTC remains strong, with projections of substantial inflows into BTC ETFs. ETH is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for a rebound, although technical indicators point to ongoing seller pressure. SOL has shown resilience despite large outflows, and DOGE is facing bearish sentiment, although a recent lawsuit dismissal may provide some relief. In this environment, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, institutional interest and potential ETF inflows provide a bullish long-term outlook. However, current market conditions warrant caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential for a technical breakout suggest a moderate buy, but ongoing seller pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Resilience in the face of outflows and positive news regarding decentralization support a stronger buy signal, especially given its past performance.

DOGE: -0.1 — While the lawsuit dismissal is positive, bearish sentiment and lack of strong bullish indicators suggest a cautious stance. Reduce exposure slightly.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current holdings as a hedge against market volatility, given the lack of significant news and stable price behavior."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish undertone. Bitcoin is experiencing pressure due to broader market concerns related to U.S. stock weakness and inflation, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a long-term positive. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential upward movement despite current technical pressures. Solana's narrative is mixed, with strong performance despite significant outflows, and a focus on its decentralization efforts. Dogecoin is facing bearish sentiment, compounded by recent legal news and community interest in alternative investments. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — While BTC is under pressure from macroeconomic factors, the long-term bullish outlook from institutional interest provides a modest positive signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout signals suggest a slight preference for ETH, despite current bearish indicators.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite large outflows, Solana's strong performance and decentralization efforts provide a marginally positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.1 — Bearish sentiment and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market environment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for potential opportunities."
2024-09-03 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and weakness in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has experienced a dip below $58k, influenced by these broader market conditions, although there remains a long-term bullish outlook from institutional investors regarding BTC ETFs. Ethereum is seeing accumulation by whales and is positioned at a technical level that could suggest a breakout, though seller pressure is evident. Solana's fundamentals remain strong despite large outflows, and it continues to perform well. Dogecoin is facing bearish sentiment, but recent legal news has removed some uncertainty. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional interest in BTC ETFs provides a supportive long-term outlook. However, current technical indicators do not signal a strong immediate buy.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential for a technical breakout suggest a cautious positive outlook, though seller pressure remains a concern.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong performance and resilience in the face of large outflows, coupled with positive news on decentralization, make SOL relatively attractive.

DOGE: -0.1 — While the dismissal of the lawsuit is positive, the overall sentiment remains bearish, and there is no strong catalyst for upward movement.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market conditions, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent, as it provides stability amidst uncertainty."
2024-09-03 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent dip in Bitcoin prices linked to broader market concerns, including rising inflation pressures. Despite this, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, particularly with the potential for significant inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum shows signs of potential upward movement, with whales accumulating and technical patterns suggesting a possible breakout. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience despite large outflows, supported by its decentralized network narrative. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, although legal clarity and community interest in new projects provide some stability. USDT remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional interest and potential ETF inflows provide a bullish outlook. However, the current macroeconomic environment warrants caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by large holders and technical patterns indicating a potential breakout suggest a moderate buy signal, although caution is advised due to current market conditions.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's resilience and strong performance despite outflows, along with positive decentralization news, make it relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with legal clarity but bearish price action. No strong signals to adjust current holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — In a cautious market, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent, but a slight reduction is warranted to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."
2024-09-03 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with macroeconomic indicators such as rising inflation pressures and a dip in U.S. stocks contributing to a broader market slump. Bitcoin has been dragged below $58,000, reflecting this bearish sentiment, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains a long-term bullish factor. Ethereum shows potential for a technical breakout despite current selling pressure, as whales accumulate at lower levels. Solana continues to demonstrate resilience, outperforming despite large outflows and maintaining a strong narrative around decentralization. Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment, with its price struggling to maintain above $0.10, although community interest in new ICOs suggests some speculative appetite. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite institutional interest in BTC ETFs, the current market slump and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

**ETH: +0.2** — Accumulation by whales and potential for a technical breakout indicate a cautious buy signal, though selling pressure remains a concern.

**SOL: +0.5** — Strong performance despite outflows and positive news about decentralization support a moderate increase in allocation.

**DOGE: -0.2** — Bearish sentiment and lack of significant positive catalysts warrant a slight reduction in exposure, though legal clarity is a minor positive.

**USDT: +0.3** — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and a dip in U.S. stocks, which have impacted the crypto market. Bitcoin is experiencing a slump, trading below $58k, although institutional interest in BTC ETFs remains strong, suggesting potential long-term bullishness. Ethereum is showing signs of accumulation by large holders, despite technical signals indicating potential downward pressure. Solana has shown resilience despite large outflows, supported by a narrative of decentralization. Dogecoin is facing bearish sentiment, but recent legal news and community interest in new ICOs provide some positive outlook. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite institutional interest, the current market slump and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral stance. 

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales and potential technical breakout provide a slightly positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to current market conditions.

SOL: +0.3 — Resilience in the face of large outflows and positive decentralization narrative support a modestly positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Bearish sentiment and low on-chain activity warrant a slight reduction in exposure, though legal news provides some support.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish tilt, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a stable asset is prudent."
2024-09-03 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by a broader market dip linked to weakness in U.S. stocks and rising inflation pressures. Bitcoin has dropped below $58k, reflecting this downturn, although institutional interest remains strong with potential inflows into BTC ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential bullish sentiment despite technical pressures. Solana has shown resilience with significant gains over the past year, even amid large outflows, while Dogecoin faces bearish sentiment despite a dismissed lawsuit and community interest in new ICOs. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively high VIX and a strong U.S. dollar, suggest a cautious market environment, favoring stability and defensive positioning.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite institutional interest, the recent price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Reducing exposure aligns with current bearish sentiment and macroeconomic pressures.

**ETH: 0.0** — While there is accumulation by whales and potential for a technical breakout, mixed signals and recent price decreases warrant a neutral stance.

**SOL: +0.2** — Solana's resilience and positive long-term performance, even with large outflows, make it relatively attractive. However, the current market environment suggests only a modest increase in allocation.

**DOGE: -0.1** — The bearish sentiment and lack of significant positive developments, despite the lawsuit dismissal, suggest a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

**USDT: +0.5** — Given the bearish market conditions and high volatility, increasing USDT holdings provides a defensive position, allowing flexibility for future opportunities."
