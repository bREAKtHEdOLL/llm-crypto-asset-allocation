2024-11-05 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and mixed sentiment, largely driven by political developments related to the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin and Solana have shown strong price movements, buoyed by optimism around pro-crypto policies and positive market sentiment. Ethereum, while lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, has seen increased interest in leveraged ETFs, indicating potential future price appreciation. Dogecoin has experienced a notable rally, supported by endorsements and election optimism. Tether's recent expansion in circulating supply underscores its role as a stable asset amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's strong rally and potential for pro-crypto policies provide a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to election-related uncertainties.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has lagged behind, the increased demand for leveraged ETFs suggests potential upside. The asset remains attractive for moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's significant gains and bullish momentum, coupled with positive market sentiment, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's resilience and recent rally, driven by endorsements and market optimism, support a positive allocation, though its speculative nature warrants caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment towards other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant political developments, particularly the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin has experienced a notable surge due to optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies, although volatility remains due to election uncertainties. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, with increased interest in leveraged ETFs suggesting potential future gains. Solana is showing strong momentum alongside Bitcoin, with potential for further price increases if support levels hold. Dogecoin has rallied on election optimism and endorsements, maintaining resilience despite market corrections. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion of supply underscores its role as a stablecoin amid these market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and positive sentiment from election-related news suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin and Solana, the increased demand for leveraged ETFs indicates potential for future gains, warranting a modest positive score.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rally alongside Bitcoin and the potential for retesting higher price levels make it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price corrections, Dogecoin's resilience and positive sentiment from endorsements provide a supportive environment for potential gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-05 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by political developments and election-related news. Bitcoin has shown significant volatility, initially surging due to pro-crypto sentiments associated with Trump's election lead but facing uncertainty due to potential election disputes. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, with increased interest in leveraged ETFs suggesting potential future gains. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum alongside Bitcoin, with analysts targeting higher price points. Dogecoin has rallied significantly on election optimism and endorsements, showing resilience even amid broader market corrections. Tether's expansion of its circulating supply underscores its role as a stable asset amid these fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's potential for gains driven by political developments and investor optimism supports a moderately bullish stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is currently underperforming compared to Bitcoin and Solana, with no strong technical or sentiment indicators to warrant a change in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong rally and bullish momentum, coupled with positive analyst predictions, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's resilience and recent rally on election optimism suggest a modestly positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to potential market corrections.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-11-05 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Solana showing notable strength amid political developments and election optimism. Bitcoin's price has surged significantly due to potential pro-crypto policies from a Trump election lead, although volatility remains due to election uncertainties. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with analysts predicting further gains if support levels hold. Dogecoin has also benefited from election-related enthusiasm, particularly from endorsements by influential figures. Ethereum, however, is lagging behind, with decreased institutional interest despite a rise in demand for leveraged ETFs. Tether has expanded its supply significantly, reflecting ongoing demand for stablecoins amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by election-related optimism and potential pro-crypto policies. Despite some volatility, the overall sentiment is bullish.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum is lagging behind other assets, the increased demand for leveraged ETFs suggests potential for future appreciation, albeit at a slower pace.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is showing strong momentum alongside Bitcoin, with potential for further gains if current support levels are maintained.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from election endorsements and resilience in price suggest potential for further upside, although the broader market correction warrants some caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-11-05 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by political developments and investor reactions to the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility, initially surging due to optimism around pro-crypto policies but facing instability due to election uncertainties. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, with institutional interest showing signs of waning, although leveraged ETF demand suggests potential future interest.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive election-related news suggest potential for further gains, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's performance is currently subdued with mixed signals; while leveraged ETF interest is a positive sign, it is not enough to justify a strong allocation change.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is benefiting from bullish momentum and positive news, with potential for further price appreciation, making it an attractive allocation target.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's resilience and potential to reach new highs amid positive sentiment and endorsements make it a moderate buy, though with some caution due to market correction risks.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by political developments and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility due to the U.S. presidential election, with initial optimism from a potential Trump victory boosting prices, but subsequent uncertainty causing fluctuations. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, although there is growing interest in leveraged ETFs post-election. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with bullish momentum suggesting potential for further gains. Dogecoin has seen a significant rally due to election-related endorsements, maintaining resilience despite broader market corrections. Tether's expansion of its circulating supply highlights its strategic importance in the crypto ecosystem, especially amid political ties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest continued bullish sentiment, supported by election-related optimism.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin and Solana, the renewed interest in leveraged ETFs and bullish MACD signal provide a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rally in tandem with Bitcoin and potential for retesting previous highs indicate strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's price surge driven by election endorsements and resilience in the face of market corrections suggest potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-05 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly optimistic, driven by significant political developments, particularly the U.S. presidential election, which has influenced investor sentiment across the crypto space. Bitcoin has seen a notable surge, reflecting optimism for pro-crypto policies, while Dogecoin has also rallied on election-related endorsements. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, with decreased institutional interest, although there is renewed interest in leveraged ETFs. Solana is experiencing gains alongside Bitcoin, with potential for further price appreciation. Meanwhile, Tether has expanded its supply, highlighting its ongoing role as a liquidity provider in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive election-related news suggest continued bullish sentiment. Increased on-chain activity supports further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Although lagging behind BTC and SOL, the rise in leveraged ETF demand indicates potential for future appreciation. However, current momentum is less compelling.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive price action and bullish news suggest potential for further gains. The market is targeting higher price levels, supported by strong momentum.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and strong election-related endorsements suggest continued bullish momentum. Potential for reaching new yearly highs.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's risk appetite increasing, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and DOGE."
2024-11-05 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, primarily driven by political developments, with Bitcoin and Solana experiencing significant gains amid optimism surrounding the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin's price surge reflects investor confidence in pro-crypto policies, while Solana's rally aligns with Bitcoin's upward momentum. Dogecoin has also shown resilience, buoyed by endorsements and election optimism. Meanwhile, Ethereum lags behind, with analysts pointing to decreased institutional interest. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, suggesting a cautious but optimistic market outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by positive election-related news and increased on-chain activity. The bullish sentiment and potential for further gains make it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, Ethereum shows renewed investor interest through leveraged ETF demand. However, its relative underperformance warrants a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price gains and bullish momentum, coupled with analyst predictions of further upside, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's resilience and potential to reach new yearly highs, driven by election optimism and endorsements, justify a positive allocation score.

USDT: -0.4 — With the broader market showing bullish trends, there is a shift away from stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets."
2024-11-05 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by political developments and strong bullish momentum in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant gains due to optimism surrounding the U.S. presidential election, although some volatility persists due to potential election uncertainties. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, but there is renewed interest in leveraged ETFs, suggesting potential for future appreciation. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with analysts predicting further gains if current support levels are maintained. Dogecoin is also benefiting from election optimism and endorsements, showing resilience despite broader market corrections. Tether continues to expand its supply, highlighting its role as a stablecoin amidst political ties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive election-related news support further gains. On-chain activity and technical indicators are favorable.

ETH: +0.3 — While lagging behind BTC and SOL, increased interest in leveraged ETFs and potential for future growth warrant a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Significant gains alongside Bitcoin and potential for further price appreciation to $180 make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Election optimism and endorsements have driven recent price surges, with potential for further gains if bullish trends continue.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive."

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by political developments and investor optimism. Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge due to potential pro-crypto policies from a Trump election lead, although volatility remains due to election uncertainties. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, but there is renewed interest in leveraged ETFs post-election. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with analysts predicting further gains. Dogecoin is benefiting from election optimism and endorsements, showing resilience despite broader market corrections. Tether continues to expand its supply, highlighting its role in the market amidst political ties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive election-related news suggest continued bullish sentiment. High on-chain activity supports this view.

ETH: +0.2 — While lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, the increase in leveraged ETF demand indicates potential for future appreciation, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Significant price gains and bullish analyst predictions suggest strong momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Election optimism and endorsements have boosted Dogecoin, and its resilience in the face of market corrections supports a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-11-05 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by political developments and positive price momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant gains due to optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies following the U.S. presidential election, although some volatility remains due to election uncertainties. Ethereum, while lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, sees increased interest in leveraged ETFs, suggesting potential future appreciation. Solana and Dogecoin are also benefiting from the bullish sentiment, with Solana targeting higher price levels and Dogecoin rallying on election optimism. Tether's increased supply reflects ongoing demand for stablecoins, although the broader market's risk appetite is currently favoring more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment related to political developments support a bullish outlook. The current portfolio can benefit from increased BTC exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, the increased interest in leveraged ETFs indicates potential for future gains. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.6 — Significant price gains and bullish analyst predictions suggest further upside potential. Increasing SOL allocation aligns with current market trends.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price surge and positive sentiment from endorsements and election optimism warrant a higher allocation, although caution is advised due to potential volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish market sentiment and increased risk appetite, reducing USDT exposure is appropriate to allocate more capital to other assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-05 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a bullish sentiment, driven largely by political developments and investor optimism. Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility due to the U.S. presidential election, with potential pro-crypto policies under a Trump administration boosting investor confidence. Ethereum, while lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, is seeing renewed interest through leveraged ETFs. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, supported by strong technical indicators and bullish analyst predictions. Dogecoin has shown resilience, buoyed by endorsements and election optimism, suggesting potential for further gains. Tether's recent expansion in supply underscores its role as a liquidity provider amid these market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, driven by political developments and bullish technical indicators, makes it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, Ethereum's renewed interest through leveraged ETFs and potential for future gains justify a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's rally alongside Bitcoin, supported by bullish momentum and positive analyst forecasts, suggests a favorable environment for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's resilience and potential to reach new yearly highs amid election optimism and endorsements warrant a positive allocation score.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall market sentiment being bullish and capital likely rotating into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."
2024-11-05 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: +0.4 — Election optimism and endorsements have driven recent price increases. Despite broader market corrections, DOGE shows resilience and potential for further gains.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, driven by significant political developments, particularly the U.S. presidential election, which has sparked optimism for pro-crypto policies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable surge, reflecting investor confidence, although there is some volatility due to election uncertainties. Ethereum is lagging behind in terms of price movement but has seen increased interest in leveraged ETFs, indicating potential for future gains. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with analysts predicting further upward movement. Dogecoin has also shown resilience and potential for reaching new highs, buoyed by endorsements and market enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply, highlighting its role as a stablecoin amidst these market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment linked to political developments suggest further gains. Current holdings should be increased to capitalize on bullish trends.

ETH: +0.3 — Although lagging behind Bitcoin, the increased demand for leveraged ETFs indicates potential for future appreciation. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Significant price gains and bullish analyst predictions support a positive outlook. Increase exposure to benefit from potential upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, endorsements and market enthusiasm provide a supportive backdrop. Maintain a slightly positive stance for potential gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reduce exposure to stablecoins to allocate capital towards growth opportunities."
2024-11-05 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, driven by political developments such as Donald Trump's election lead, which has positively impacted Bitcoin and, by extension, other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, reflecting investor optimism for pro-crypto policies. Solana and Dogecoin are also experiencing strong upward momentum, aligning with Bitcoin's rally. Ethereum, however, is lagging behind, with decreased institutional interest despite a rise in demand for leveraged ETFs. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, suggesting a shift from stablecoins like USDT to more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive election-related news have bolstered Bitcoin's price, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin and Solana, the rise in leveraged ETF demand post-election indicates potential for future appreciation, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's significant gains and bullish analyst predictions suggest strong momentum, making it a favorable asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's rally, supported by election optimism and endorsements, indicates potential for further gains, justifying a positive allocation score.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-05 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana, which are experiencing strong upward momentum and positive news catalysts. Bitcoin's surge is linked to political developments, specifically the U.S. presidential election, which has sparked optimism for pro-crypto policies. Ethereum, while lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, shows potential for future appreciation as indicated by increased demand for leveraged ETFs. Dogecoin is also benefiting from election-related enthusiasm, with endorsements from high-profile figures contributing to its rally. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion of its circulating supply indicates ongoing demand for stablecoins, although the broader market's bullish sentiment suggests a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive election-related news suggest continued bullishness. On-chain activity supports this trend.

ETH: +0.3 — Although lagging behind BTC and SOL, the increased interest in leveraged ETFs indicates potential for future gains. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

SOL: +0.7 — Significant gains alongside Bitcoin and bullish analyst predictions suggest strong potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Benefiting from election optimism and endorsements, with potential to reach new highs if bullish trends persist.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market's bullish sentiment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-11-05 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is largely bullish, driven by the recent U.S. presidential election developments, which have positively impacted Bitcoin, Solana, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin's price has surged significantly, reflecting optimism for pro-crypto policies, although volatility remains due to election uncertainties. Ethereum, while lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, is seeing increased interest in leveraged ETFs, suggesting potential future gains. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with analysts predicting further price increases if support levels hold. Dogecoin has also experienced a rally, bolstered by endorsements and election optimism. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion of its circulating supply indicates continued demand for stablecoins, although the broader market's bullish sentiment may lead to capital rotation away from USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive election-related news support further gains. Increased on-chain activity and price breakout signals reinforce confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — While lagging behind BTC and SOL, the rise in leveraged ETF demand suggests potential for upward movement. Technical indicators remain positive.

SOL: +0.6 — Significant price gains and bullish momentum, with analysts targeting higher price levels. Strong correlation with BTC's rally adds to attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.5 — Election optimism and endorsements have driven recent price increases. Potential for further gains if bullish trends persist.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's bullish sentiment, there is likely to be a rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

The current market sentiment is mixed, with significant volatility driven by political developments, particularly the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin and Solana have shown strong upward momentum, buoyed by optimism surrounding potential pro-crypto policies from a Trump victory.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment suggest continued bullish potential, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — While lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, the increased demand for leveraged ETFs indicates potential for future gains, justifying a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's significant price gains and bullish analyst predictions support a favorable outlook, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent rallies, Dogecoin's significant price decrease in the last hour and mixed news sentiment suggest a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with significant upward momentum in Bitcoin and Solana, driven by political developments and investor optimism. Bitcoin experienced a notable surge due to election-related optimism, although it faces volatility from potential election disputes. Ethereum, while lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, sees increased interest in leveraged ETFs, indicating potential future gains. Solana is riding the wave alongside Bitcoin, with analysts predicting further gains if current support levels hold. Dogecoin's price is buoyed by election optimism and endorsements, showing resilience despite broader market corrections. Tether's increased supply highlights its role as a stablecoin amidst political ties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news sentiment related to the election boost confidence in Bitcoin's upward trajectory.

ETH: +0.3 — While lagging behind BTC and SOL, the increased demand for leveraged ETFs suggests potential for future appreciation, warranting a modest positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Significant gains and bullish momentum, supported by both technical indicators and optimistic price targets, make Solana an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from endorsements and election optimism, along with resilience in price, justify a slight positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-05 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by political developments and election-related news. Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge due to potential pro-crypto policies with Trump's election lead, although volatility remains due to election uncertainties. Ethereum is lagging behind Bitcoin and Solana, with decreased institutional interest but increased demand for leveraged ETFs. Solana is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with bullish momentum suggesting potential price targets. Dogecoin has shown resilience and optimism, fueled by endorsements and election optimism. Tether's expansion of its circulating supply reflects ongoing demand for stablecoins amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive election-related news support a bullish outlook, despite some volatility risks.

ETH: +0.3 — While lagging behind Bitcoin, increased interest in leveraged ETFs and potential future price targets provide a moderate positive signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Significant gains alongside Bitcoin and bullish analyst predictions suggest continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.2 — Election optimism and resilience in the face of market corrections provide a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases with bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted."
2024-11-05 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

2024-11-05 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin has shown resilience and bullish sentiment driven by election optimism and endorsements, although it faces broader market corrections.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, the preference is to reduce exposure to stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-06 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism for pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged, reflecting increased investor confidence.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and political developments. Bitcoin has hit a record high, supported by expectations of favorable regulatory policies under the new U.S. administration. Ethereum is experiencing renewed institutional interest, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows. Solana has surged to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, reflecting investor optimism. Dogecoin has also seen a substantial price increase, fueled by speculation of potential crypto-friendly policies. Tether's market cap has grown, highlighting its role as a liquidity anchor amid increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with record high prices and increased on-chain activity. Positive news regarding potential regulatory support further supports a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant price spike and ETF inflows suggest a positive outlook. The scarcity mode narrative adds to the bullish sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong price performance and its rise to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency position indicate continued investor interest. Positive news and technical indicators support a buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has experienced a significant price increase, the momentum is largely speculative. The potential for policy influence adds some bullish sentiment, but caution is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows strong bullish trends, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for liquidity anchoring."
2024-11-06 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant political developments in the U.S. that are perceived as favorable to the crypto industry. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged, reflecting increased investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing renewed institutional interest, while Solana has climbed to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Dogecoin has seen a substantial rally, likely influenced by speculative enthusiasm tied to potential political influences. Tether remains a stable liquidity anchor, with its market cap increasing amid heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with a new all-time high and positive news regarding potential regulatory support. This makes it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's recent price spike and significant ETF inflows indicate strong demand and institutional interest, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's surge to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and its outperformance against Ethereum highlight its growing appeal, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and its role in leading the memecoin rally suggest continued investor enthusiasm, making it a candidate for moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT aligns with the current market trend."
2024-11-06 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant political developments with the U.S. election results favoring a pro-crypto administration. This has led to a surge in prices across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and Ethereum experiencing a substantial price increase. The broader market capitalization has climbed to $2.45 trillion, reflecting increased investor confidence. Notably, Solana has overtaken Binance Coin to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, and Dogecoin has seen a significant rally, likely influenced by speculation around potential crypto-friendly policies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with a new all-time high and favorable macroeconomic news. The bullish sentiment is supported by both technical indicators and positive news regarding regulatory expectations.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum with significant price increases and institutional inflows into ETFs, suggesting continued upward potential.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent surge and its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, coupled with positive technical indicators, support a moderately bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's price has spiked significantly, driven by speculative news and a broader memecoin rally, indicating a short-term bullish trend.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, there is a likely rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-06 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and political developments. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, fueled by expectations of favorable regulatory policies under the incoming Trump administration. This optimism has spilled over into other cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experiencing significant price increases. Ethereum's reduced supply and institutional interest, Solana's rise to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, and Dogecoin's memecoin rally all contribute to the positive market outlook. Meanwhile, Tether's increased market capitalization highlights its role as a liquidity anchor amid heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, record high price, and positive news regarding potential pro-crypto policies make it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's entry into 'scarcity mode' and significant ETF inflows suggest strong demand and potential for further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's surge to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and its outperformance against Ethereum indicate robust investor interest and potential for continued gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Despite recent price volatility, Dogecoin's strong rally and potential influence from Elon Musk in the new administration support a positive outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's market cap has increased, the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a reduced need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-06 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by a surge in cryptocurrency prices following the U.S. election results, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and Ethereum experiencing significant price spikes.

**Bitcoin (BTC)**

1. **Bitcoin Hits Record High Amid Trump Election Victory**

2. **Crypto Market Cap Reaches $2.45 Trillion**

2. **Ethereum ETFs See $132 Million Inflows**

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant political developments with the election of Donald Trump, which is perceived to be favorable for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, and Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze, both contributing to a surge in the total crypto market capitalization. Solana has also gained traction, becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, while Dogecoin has seen a speculative rally linked to potential political influences. Tether's market cap has increased, reflecting its role as a liquidity anchor amid these movements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with a record high price and positive news regarding regulatory expectations. This makes it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scarcity mode and institutional inflows signal a strong bullish trend, although slightly tempered by its recent price decrease.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rise to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and its outperformance against Ethereum suggest continued strength, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, Dogecoin's political speculation and memecoin rally provide a moderate bullish outlook, though with higher risk.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market sentiment shifts towards risk assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on the bullish trends in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-06 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-06 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism following the U.S. election results, with expectations of a pro-crypto administration under President-elect Donald Trump. Bitcoin has hit a record high, and the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged to $2.45 trillion, indicating strong investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing increased demand and institutional interest, while Solana has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, showing strong performance against Ethereum. Dogecoin has seen significant gains due to speculative enthusiasm linked to potential political influences. Tether's market cap has also increased, highlighting its role as a liquidity anchor amid heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, hitting record highs with positive news on regulatory expectations. The bullish sentiment and technical indicators support further capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum and institutional interest, with positive news on reduced supply and ETF inflows. This suggests potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong performance and recent surge to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, along with positive news, make it an attractive asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Dogecoin's significant gains and speculative interest tied to political developments suggest moderate potential for further upside.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to USDT is warranted as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-06 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

2024-11-06 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant political developments in the U.S., with the election of Donald Trump anticipated to bring a pro-crypto stance. This has led to record highs in Bitcoin and strong performances across other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. The broader crypto market cap has surged to $2.45 trillion, reflecting increased investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze, while Solana and Dogecoin are benefiting from increased investor interest and optimism about potential regulatory support. Tether remains a key liquidity anchor, with its market cap rising significantly.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with record highs and increased on-chain activity. The political climate is expected to favor Bitcoin, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is in a bullish phase with reduced supply and increased demand. Institutional interest is picking up, supported by ETF inflows, which could drive further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent price surge and its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency indicate strong market confidence. Its performance against Ethereum suggests potential for continued growth.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin is seeing significant gains driven by speculative interest and political developments. While it's riskier, the current sentiment supports a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market in a bullish phase, there is a shift towards risk assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings. However, USDT remains important for liquidity, warranting only a slight reduction."
2024-11-06 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results that have led to increased investor confidence and expectations of favorable regulatory policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged to $2.45 trillion. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze with significant ETF inflows, while Solana has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, outperforming Ethereum. Dogecoin has seen significant gains amid speculation of potential influence from Elon Musk in the new administration. Tether's market cap has also increased, reflecting its role as a liquidity anchor.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by record-high prices and increased on-chain activity. The positive news regarding potential pro-crypto policies further bolsters confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's reduced supply and increased demand, along with significant ETF inflows, indicate strong bullish sentiment. The potential for a rally towards $6,000 adds to its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent surge and its new status as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency highlight strong market interest. Its outperformance against Ethereum suggests continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite a recent price decrease, Dogecoin's earlier significant gains and potential political influence from Elon Musk provide a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted given its volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing strong bullish sentiment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-06 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-06 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism for pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged, reflecting increased investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze, leading to significant price gains and renewed institutional interest. Solana has also seen a strong rally, becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Dogecoin has benefited from speculative enthusiasm, although its recent price volatility suggests caution. Tether's market cap growth underscores its role as a liquidity anchor in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong on-chain activity, coupled with positive news about potential regulatory support, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's entry into a scarcity mode and significant ETF inflows indicate strong demand, supporting further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rise to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and its outperformance against Ethereum highlight its growing appeal, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent gains, Dogecoin's significant price volatility and speculative nature suggest maintaining current exposure without further increase.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is rotating out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-06 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism about potential pro-crypto regulatory policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged, reflecting increased investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze, leading to a significant price increase, while Solana has outperformed Ethereum, becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Dogecoin has also seen a substantial rally, fueled by speculation of favorable crypto policies. Tether's market cap has grown, underscoring its role as a liquidity anchor amid heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive news about potential regulatory support under the new U.S. administration suggest strong upward momentum. The technical indicators are also supportive, with bullish trend and momentum signals.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's entry into a 'scarcity mode' and significant ETF inflows indicate strong demand and potential for further price appreciation. The technicals are bullish, reinforcing the positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent surge and its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap highlight its growing appeal. The technical indicators remain bullish, supporting continued strength.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Dogecoin's rally tied to political developments and increased investor appetite for risk assets suggests potential for further gains. However, caution is warranted given its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish market sentiment, there is likely to be capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets."
2024-11-06 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results favoring a pro-crypto stance under President-elect Donald Trump. This has led to significant rallies across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and Ethereum entering a scarcity phase with strong institutional inflows. Solana has also surged, becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, while Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase due to speculative interest tied to potential political developments. Tether's market cap has increased, reflecting its role as a liquidity anchor in the current environment. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on sentiment, encouraging capital rotation into cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong on-chain activity suggest continued bullish momentum. The pro-crypto political environment further supports this outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scarcity mode and significant ETF inflows indicate strong demand and potential for further price appreciation, despite recent price volatility.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent surge and its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency highlight its growing market confidence and potential for continued gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's recent rally is speculative, the positive sentiment tied to political developments and memecoin interest provides a modest bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current risk-on sentiment and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, holding a lower allocation in stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism about pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged, reflecting increased investor confidence.

USDT: -0.3 — With the bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-06 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results that have sparked optimism about potential pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a record high, and the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged, indicating increased investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing renewed institutional interest, while Solana and Dogecoin are benefiting from strong price rallies and positive sentiment. Tether's market cap has also grown, highlighting its role as a liquidity anchor in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with a record high price and positive news regarding potential regulatory support, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and significant ETF inflows suggest a favorable outlook, supported by its entry into a scarcity mode, which could drive further price increases.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent surge and its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, along with positive sentiment from outperforming Ethereum, make it a compelling choice for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite its memecoin status, Dogecoin's significant price increase and potential influence from political developments provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment and increased risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness in the portfolio."
2024-11-06 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism about potential pro-crypto regulatory policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum is experiencing a scarcity-driven rally, both contributing to the total cryptocurrency market cap reaching $2.45 trillion. Solana has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, overtaking Binance Coin, while Dogecoin has seen a significant price surge, likely influenced by speculation around Elon Musk's potential involvement in the new administration. Tether's market cap has also increased, reflecting its role as a liquidity anchor amid heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's all-time high and bullish sentiment from the election results suggest strong upward momentum. The buy signals from technical indicators further support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's scarcity mode and significant ETF inflows indicate strong demand and potential for further price increases, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rise to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and its outperformance against Ethereum highlight its growing appeal, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's price surge and memecoin rally suggest increased investor interest, though the speculative nature warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish trends, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, suggesting a reduction in exposure."
2024-11-06 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism about potential pro-crypto regulatory policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged to $2.45 trillion. Ethereum is experiencing increased demand and institutional interest, while Solana has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Dogecoin has also seen significant gains, fueled by speculation about Elon Musk's influence in the new administration. Tether's market cap has grown, reflecting its role as a liquidity anchor amid heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and favorable news about potential regulatory support suggest strong bullish momentum. The market data also supports this with consistent buy signals.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scarcity mode and significant ETF inflows indicate strong demand and potential for further price increases. The bullish momentum in market data aligns with this view.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent surge and its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, along with positive news and market data, suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite the lack of strong technical signals, Dogecoin's price surge and positive sentiment tied to political developments warrant a moderately positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market sentiment shifts towards riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on the bullish momentum in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-06 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism about potential pro-crypto regulatory policies under the new administration. Bitcoin and Ethereum have hit record highs, with significant price increases and positive news about institutional interest and reduced supply. Solana has also seen a notable surge, becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, while Dogecoin has experienced a strong rally fueled by speculative enthusiasm. Tether's market cap has increased, reflecting its role as a liquidity anchor amid heightened market activity. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, supporting the current bullish sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, record high prices, and positive news about potential regulatory support make it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's significant price spike and institutional inflows suggest a strong bullish trend, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rise to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and its outperformance against Ethereum indicate positive momentum, though slightly less pronounced than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite the recent rally, Dogecoin's speculative nature and lack of strong technical signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-06 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. election results, which have sparked optimism about potential pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, reflecting increased investor confidence, while Ethereum and Solana are experiencing significant inflows and price spikes due to reduced supply and increased demand. Dogecoin has also seen a substantial rally, fueled by speculation about Elon Musk's potential influence in the new administration. Tether's role as a liquidity anchor remains strong, with its market capitalization increasing significantly.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong bullish momentum, supported by positive macroeconomic news and increased on-chain activity, make it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's entry into 'scarcity mode' and significant ETF inflows suggest strong upward potential, warranting a higher allocation despite the recent slight price decrease.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent surge and its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, along with positive sentiment from outperforming Ethereum, justify a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Dogecoin's significant price increase and strong investor enthusiasm tied to political developments support a cautious increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall market sentiment being bullish and a shift towards riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-07 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant macroeconomic and political developments. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high following the U.S. presidential election, with expectations of pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Ethereum is also experiencing a surge in price due to optimism around potential ETF approvals and increased institutional demand. Solana is gaining traction, surpassing Binance Coin in market cap amid speculation of a possible ETF approval. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is experiencing volatility, with recent dips following overbought signals, despite positive sentiment from potential political developments involving Elon Musk. Tether's recent activities indicate a strong demand for liquidity, particularly on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with significant whale accumulation and positive news, suggests continued bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic context supports further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from ETF optimism and outperforming other major cryptos. Strong technical indicators and institutional interest provide a solid foundation for further price increases.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's market cap growth and ETF speculation are driving positive sentiment. While technical indicators are mixed, the overall market environment is supportive of further gains.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite positive sentiment from potential political developments, recent overbought signals and price dips suggest caution. Holding current positions is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market exhibiting bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT in favor of riskier assets. The current environment suggests reducing stablecoin exposure."
2024-11-07 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant political developments and ETF speculation. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, buoyed by expectations of pro-crypto policies under the new U.S. administration. Ethereum is experiencing strong upward momentum, fueled by optimism around a potential staked Ether ETF, while Solana is gaining traction due to similar ETF speculation and surpassing Binance Coin in market cap. Dogecoin, despite a recent dip from overbought signals, is seeing renewed interest due to potential political developments involving Elon Musk. Tether's recent chain swap and minting activities indicate increased demand for liquidity on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and whale accumulation signal strong confidence and potential for further gains, supported by favorable macroeconomic and political conditions.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum is outperforming major cryptos with strong price momentum and ETF optimism, making it highly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive price action and market cap growth, driven by ETF speculation, suggest continued upward potential, though slightly tempered by recent technical signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent enthusiasm from potential political ties, Dogecoin's technical indicators remain weak, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent."
2024-11-07 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-07 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant price movements and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, driven by expectations of pro-crypto policies under the new U.S. administration, and major whales have shown confidence by accumulating substantial amounts of BTC. Ethereum is experiencing a surge due to optimism around a potential staked Ether ETF, outperforming other major cryptocurrencies. Solana is also gaining traction, with speculation of an ETF approval boosting its price and market cap. However, Dogecoin is experiencing a pullback after overbought signals, despite some positive sentiment from potential political developments involving Elon Musk. Tether's recent activities suggest a strategic consolidation of liquidity on the Ethereum network, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment with new all-time highs and significant whale accumulation. Positive macroeconomic and political developments support further upside.

ETH: +0.7 — Continued bullish momentum with ETF optimism and strong price performance relative to peers. Institutional interest is a positive indicator.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price movement and speculation around ETF approval suggest further growth potential. Surpassing Binance Coin in market cap adds to its attractiveness.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price dip due to overbought conditions and profit-taking. Despite some positive sentiment, technical indicators suggest caution.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-07 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments such as the U.S. presidential election outcome and its perceived pro-crypto policies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, with substantial whale accumulation indicating strong confidence. Ethereum is showing robust performance with optimism around a potential staked Ether ETF, and Solana is gaining traction due to ETF speculation and surpassing Binance Coin in market cap. Conversely, Dogecoin has experienced a decline due to overbought signals, despite some positive sentiment from potential political developments. Tether's activity reflects increased demand for liquidity on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and whale accumulation suggest strong upward momentum. The macroeconomic environment and pro-crypto sentiment further support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's price surge and ETF optimism, combined with outperforming other major cryptos, indicate strong investor interest and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price increase and market cap growth, driven by ETF speculation and DeFi demand, make it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite some positive sentiment from potential political developments, recent overbought signals and price decline suggest caution is warranted.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-07 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent macroeconomic and political developments. Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs following the U.S. presidential election, with expectations of pro-crypto policies under the new administration.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive news on ETF speculation and market cap growth, along with consistent buy signals, indicate a favorable outlook despite recent price fluctuations.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite some positive sentiment, Dogecoin is experiencing significant price declines and technical overbought signals, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

2024-11-07 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-07 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent political developments and speculation about potential crypto-friendly policies under the new U.S. administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, supported by institutional interest and large whale accumulations. Ethereum is experiencing a surge due to ETF optimism and outperforming other major cryptocurrencies. Solana is gaining traction with speculation about ETF approval and surpassing Binance Coin in market cap. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with a recent dip due to overbought conditions, despite speculative enthusiasm around Elon Musk's potential role in the Trump administration. Tether is actively managing liquidity on the Ethereum network, indicating robust demand for stablecoin transactions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong whale accumulation suggest robust bullish sentiment, supported by potential pro-crypto policies.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price surge and ETF optimism indicate strong investor interest, although recent momentum has slightly cooled.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive market cap movement and ETF speculation provide a favorable outlook, despite recent minor price fluctuations.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent overbought signals and price dip suggest caution, though speculative sentiment remains due to Elon Musk's potential influence.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive."
2024-11-07 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-07 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent macroeconomic developments and news. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high following the U.S. presidential election, with expectations of pro-crypto policies under Trump's administration. This has led to significant whale accumulation, indicating strong confidence in Bitcoin's future. Ethereum is also experiencing a positive trend, fueled by optimism over potential ETF approvals and increased institutional interest. Solana's price has surged past $200 on similar ETF speculation, overtaking Binance Coin in market cap. However, Dogecoin has faced a dip due to overbought signals, despite some positive sentiment from potential political developments involving Elon Musk. Tether's recent chain swap and minting activities suggest increased demand for liquidity on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong whale accumulation signal robust confidence and potential for further gains. The macroeconomic context supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from ETF optimism and outperforming other major cryptos post-election. Despite mixed technicals, the news supports a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong market cap growth and ETF speculation provide a bullish backdrop, though recent price decreases warrant a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price dip and overbought signals suggest caution, although potential political developments could provide future support.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-07 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent macroeconomic developments and political changes. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high following Donald Trump's election victory, with significant whale accumulation indicating strong confidence in its future. Ethereum is experiencing a surge due to optimism around a potential staked Ether ETF, outperforming other major cryptocurrencies. Solana is also benefiting from ETF speculation and has surpassed Binance Coin in market cap, reflecting strong investor interest.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and substantial whale accumulation signal strong bullish sentiment and potential for further gains, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's positive momentum from ETF speculation and outperforming other cryptos post-election suggest a favorable outlook, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong market cap growth and ETF speculation provide a bullish backdrop, supporting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent price decline and overbought signals indicate caution, suggesting a reduction in exposure to manage downside risk.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent political developments and potential regulatory changes. Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high following the U.S. presidential election, with significant whale accumulation indicating strong confidence in its future. Ethereum is also experiencing positive momentum due to speculation around a staked Ether ETF, contributing to its outperformance relative to other major cryptocurrencies. Solana is gaining traction, surpassing Binance Coin in market cap, fueled by ETF speculation and DeFi demand. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has seen a decline due to overbought signals, although potential political developments involving Elon Musk have stirred some positive sentiment. Tether's recent chain swap and minting activities suggest increased demand for liquidity on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strong upward momentum and whale accumulation post-election, along with the all-time high, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The macroeconomic context also supports further growth.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive news about potential ETF approval and strong institutional interest provide a bullish outlook, despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Speculation around a Solana ETF and its recent market cap surge over Binance Coin indicate strong institutional interest and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent declines due to overbought conditions, the potential involvement of Elon Musk in the Trump administration could boost sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, holding a large stablecoin position may be less advantageous in the current market environment."
2024-11-07 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant macroeconomic and political developments. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high post-election, supported by expectations of pro-crypto policies under the new administration and substantial whale accumulation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and significant whale accumulation signal strong bullish momentum, making it a priority for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's strong price surge and potential ETF approval create a favorable environment for growth, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price breakout and market cap growth, driven by ETF speculation and DeFi demand, suggest a promising outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent enthusiasm, Dogecoin's technical indicators suggest caution due to overbought conditions, leading to a neutral stance.

2024-11-07 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-07 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the market, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-07 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant macroeconomic and political developments. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, buoyed by expectations of pro-crypto policies following Donald Trump's election victory. This has led to increased institutional interest and whale accumulation. Ethereum is also experiencing a surge, fueled by optimism over potential ETF approvals and strong institutional demand. Solana is gaining traction, surpassing $200 due to speculation of ETF approval and overtaking Binance Coin in market cap. Despite a recent dip due to overbought signals, Dogecoin sentiment remains positive, partly due to speculation about Elon Musk's potential role in the new administration. Tether's recent activities indicate increased demand for liquidity on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by whale accumulation and positive news, suggests continued growth potential. The macroeconomic context is also favorable for BTC.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price surge and positive news regarding ETF prospects and institutional interest make it an attractive asset, though slightly less so than BTC due to less pronounced momentum signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive price action and market cap growth, driven by ETF speculation, make it an appealing option, though it is slightly less attractive than ETH due to recent overbought signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite positive sentiment from potential political developments, recent overbought signals and price dip suggest a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable, though maintaining some stability is still beneficial in a volatile market."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the recent U.S. presidential election results, which have sparked optimism about pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum is experiencing significant gains due to ETF speculation. Solana is also benefiting from ETF speculation and has surpassed Binance Coin in market cap. Despite a recent dip, Dogecoin is seeing increased activity due to speculation about Elon Musk's potential role in the new administration. Tether has been actively managing its liquidity, indicating strong demand for stablecoins on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong whale accumulation signal robust confidence and upward momentum, making it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge and ETF optimism provide a positive outlook, although the lack of a bullish momentum signal tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price and market cap growth, driven by ETF speculation and DeFi demand, suggest continued bullish momentum, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite speculative enthusiasm, technical indicators suggest overbought conditions, and recent price dips indicate caution is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-07 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant macroeconomic and political developments. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high following Donald Trump's election victory, with expectations of pro-crypto policies boosting investor confidence. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing strong upward momentum, partly due to speculation around potential ETF approvals. However, Dogecoin has faced a recent dip due to overbought signals, despite some positive sentiment linked to Elon Musk's potential involvement in the Trump administration. Tether remains stable, with recent large-scale chain swaps indicating ongoing demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong whale accumulation signal robust bullish sentiment, supported by positive macroeconomic news.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from ETF optimism and outperforming other major cryptos, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price surge and market cap growth, driven by ETF speculation and DeFi demand, indicate strong bullish momentum.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite some positive sentiment from potential political developments, recent overbought signals and a price dip suggest caution.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across major cryptos, there is a likely capital rotation out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-07 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant political developments and ETF speculation. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high following the U.S. presidential election, with expectations of pro-crypto policies under the new administration. Major investors are accumulating Bitcoin, indicating strong confidence. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing positive momentum due to ETF hopes and increased institutional interest. However, Dogecoin faces mixed sentiment, with recent overbought signals leading to a price dip despite speculative enthusiasm around Elon Musk's potential role in the new administration. Tether's recent chain swap and minting activities suggest increased demand for liquidity on Ethereum-based platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with significant whale accumulation and positive news, supports a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic context and political developments further enhance its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price surge and ETF optimism, along with outperforming other major cryptos, indicate a favorable environment for growth. However, the lack of bullish technical momentum slightly tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's price breakout and speculation around ETF approval, along with its overtaking of Binance Coin in market cap, highlight strong bullish sentiment and potential for further gains.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some positive sentiment from potential political developments, recent overbought signals and a price dip suggest caution. Current holdings warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining a high USDT exposure is less attractive. The recent chain swap indicates a shift in liquidity demand."
2024-11-07 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge and ETF optimism are driving demand, although technical indicators are mixed. The overall sentiment remains positive with institutional interest.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price and market cap gains, alongside ETF speculation, indicate strong bullish momentum. The asset is well-positioned for further growth.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite some positive sentiment from potential political developments, Dogecoin's recent price dip and overbought signals suggest caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a rotation of capital out of stablecoins like USDT, as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-07 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant macroeconomic and political developments. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high following the U.S. presidential election, with expectations of pro-crypto policies under the new administration. This has led to increased institutional interest, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are both experiencing strong upward momentum. Solana is also gaining traction, surpassing Binance Coin in market cap, fueled by speculation of potential ETF approvals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by institutional accumulation and favorable news, suggests further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from ETF optimism and outperforming other major cryptos, indicating strong investor interest.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive momentum and market cap growth, driven by ETF speculation, make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some positive sentiment, recent overbought signals and price decline suggest caution is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by post-election enthusiasm and positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, supported by strong investor confidence and ETF-related news. Ethereum is experiencing renewed interest with positive ETF inflows, although there are concerns about potential vulnerabilities in its rollup technologies. Solana is nearing its all-time high, buoyed by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has seen a significant price increase, largely influenced by Elon Musk's support and market enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its financial services, marking its entry into commodity trading.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong investor confidence, along with positive ETF developments, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite technical vulnerabilities, the positive ETF inflows indicate renewed investor interest, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.7 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations, Solana shows robust growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen a significant price increase, the influence is largely sentiment-driven, warranting a cautious buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-08 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by post-election enthusiasm and significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum is seeing renewed interest with positive ETF inflows. Solana is nearing its all-time high, supported by increased DeFi activity and new product launches like wrapped Bitcoin on its network. Dogecoin has experienced a dramatic surge, largely influenced by Elon Musk's endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its use cases, entering commodity trading, and demonstrating its commitment to security through asset recovery efforts. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging investment in riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive news from Grayscale suggest strong upward momentum. The market's enthusiasm post-election further supports increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some technical vulnerabilities, the positive ETF inflows and overall market sentiment indicate potential for growth, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations like cbBTC, Solana presents a compelling growth opportunity.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and strong market sentiment driven by Elon Musk's influence suggest continued upward potential, justifying a higher allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — In a bullish market environment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets."
2024-11-08 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by post-election enthusiasm and significant price movements in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, and Ethereum is seeing positive ETF inflows, suggesting renewed investor interest.

Dogecoin has experienced a substantial surge, largely influenced by Elon Musk's endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its utility into commodity trading, reflecting its growing role in broader financial markets. Despite the bullish sentiment, some caution is warranted due to identified vulnerabilities in Ethereum's rollups and the need for security enhancements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive news from Grayscale suggest strong upward momentum, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows indicate renewed interest, but caution is advised due to potential vulnerabilities in rollup technologies.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and Coinbase integration, Solana shows promising growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price peaks, the influence of external factors like Elon Musk's endorsements suggests moderate potential for further gains.

2024-11-08 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-08 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, driven by post-election enthusiasm and significant price increases across major assets. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high above $77,000, supported by positive market sentiment and strategic moves by Grayscale. Ethereum is seeing renewed investor interest, as evidenced by positive ETF inflows, although concerns about rollup vulnerabilities persist. Solana is nearing its all-time high, buoyed by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like Coinbase's wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has surged significantly, largely due to Elon Musk's influence and market enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its role in financial services, including commodity trading and asset recovery.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong market sentiment, combined with strategic developments like Grayscale's ETF plans, support a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows indicate renewed interest, though caution is warranted due to potential rollup vulnerabilities. Overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: +0.7 — Approaching an all-time high with increased DeFi activity and new integrations, Solana shows strong upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and strong market enthusiasm, particularly driven by Elon Musk's influence, warrant a positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-11-08 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by a post-election surge in investor confidence and significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum is seeing positive ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest. Solana is nearing its all-time high, buoyed by increased DeFi activity, while Dogecoin has experienced a dramatic price increase, largely influenced by Elon Musk's endorsement. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its financial services, notably entering commodity trading. Despite these bullish signals, the macroeconomic environment remains stable with no major shifts in traditional financial indicators, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong investor confidence, coupled with positive news about ETF developments, make it a highly attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and investor interest support Ethereum's potential for growth, despite some technical vulnerabilities. The overall sentiment remains optimistic.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations like cbBTC, Solana presents a compelling case for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase driven by strong market enthusiasm and Elon Musk's support, though caution is warranted due to its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there's a relative decrease in the need to hold a large stablecoin position."
2024-11-08 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-08 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant positive developments. Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, driven by post-election market enthusiasm and investor confidence, while Ethereum has seen positive ETF inflows, indicating renewed interest. Solana is nearing its all-time high, supported by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like Coinbase's wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has surged significantly, largely influenced by Elon Musk's endorsements and the political climate. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its utility by entering commodity trading and demonstrating its commitment to security through asset recovery efforts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive market sentiment, along with ETF developments, suggest strong upward potential. 

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and investor interest outweigh concerns about rollup vulnerabilities, indicating moderate bullishness.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations, suggesting continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price surge driven by external endorsements and market enthusiasm, but potential volatility warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-08 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by record highs in Bitcoin and strong performance in other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana. Positive macroeconomic factors, such as post-election optimism and increased investor confidence, are contributing to this upward momentum. Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, and Ethereum is seeing renewed interest with positive ETF inflows. Solana is nearing its all-time high, fueled by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has also surged significantly, largely influenced by Elon Musk's support. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its use cases, entering commodity trading and assisting in asset recovery, indicating its growing role in financial services.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong market sentiment suggest continued upward momentum. The ETF news further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and overall bullish market sentiment provide a supportive environment, though technical vulnerabilities warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching an all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations, Solana shows robust potential for growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent gains, the influence of external factors like Elon Musk's support suggests potential volatility. However, the overall bullish sentiment remains supportive.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-08 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by post-election enthusiasm and significant price movements in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum is seeing positive ETF inflows, indicating renewed investor interest. Solana is nearing its previous all-time high, supported by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like Coinbase's wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has experienced a substantial price surge, largely influenced by Elon Musk's endorsement and the current political climate. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its role in financial services, evidenced by its involvement in a major oil trade and asset recovery efforts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive market sentiment, combined with supportive ETF news, suggest strong upward momentum. 

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and price growth potential outweigh concerns about rollup vulnerabilities, indicating a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching an all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations, Solana shows promising growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price peaks, Dogecoin's momentum is supported by ongoing market enthusiasm and influential endorsements.

2024-11-08 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows indicate renewed investor interest, though some caution is warranted due to potential rollup vulnerabilities.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations, Solana shows promising growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase and continued support from influential figures like Elon Musk bolster Dogecoin's appeal, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-08 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and Ethereum experiencing positive ETF inflows. Solana is nearing its all-time high, driven by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has also seen a significant surge post-election, largely influenced by Elon Musk's support. Despite these bullish trends, macroeconomic indicators such as a high U.S. dollar index and stable oil prices suggest a cautious approach. Tether remains stable, with its involvement in commodity trading and asset recovery efforts highlighting its expanding role in financial services.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong market sentiment, along with ETF developments, suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and price momentum, despite some technical vulnerabilities, indicate a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching all-time highs with strong DeFi activity and new integrations like cbBTC support further growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant recent price surge and strong market enthusiasm, though potential volatility warrants a moderate score.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there's a shift away from stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-08 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by post-election enthusiasm and significant price movements across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum is experiencing positive ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest. Solana is nearing its all-time high, supported by increased DeFi activity, while Dogecoin has surged significantly due to Elon Musk's influence and market optimism. Despite these bullish trends, macroeconomic indicators like the U.S. Dollar Index and Treasury yields suggest a cautious approach, with potential volatility in traditional markets. Tether's involvement in commodity trading highlights its expanding role in financial services.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive market sentiment, combined with strong technical indicators, suggest further upside potential. The ETF news adds to its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and price recovery post-election support a moderately bullish outlook, though technical vulnerabilities warrant some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and the introduction of wrapped Bitcoin on its network, Solana shows promising growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent gains, Dogecoin's price surge appears heavily influenced by external factors like Elon Musk's support, suggesting a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment in the crypto market, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-08 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $77,000 and Ethereum ETFs seeing positive inflows post-election. Solana is also nearing its all-time high, driven by increased DeFi activity and the introduction of wrapped Bitcoin on its network. Dogecoin has experienced a significant surge due to Elon Musk's endorsement and the post-election market enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its financial services, marking its entry into commodity trading. Despite the bullish sentiment, some caution is warranted due to potential vulnerabilities in Ethereum's rollup technologies and the need for security enhancements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive news from Grayscale suggest strong investor confidence and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows indicate renewed interest, but potential vulnerabilities in rollups warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Nearing its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and the introduction of wrapped Bitcoin, suggesting continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase driven by market enthusiasm and Elon Musk's support, though recent volatility suggests a moderate approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across other assets, there's a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting capital rotation into riskier assets."
2024-11-08 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-08 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching new highs and experiencing positive investor sentiment post-election. Bitcoin has surged past $77,000, setting a new record, while Ethereum is seeing increased ETF inflows, indicating renewed interest. Solana is also nearing its all-time high, driven by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like wrapped Bitcoin on its network. Dogecoin has seen a significant price increase, largely influenced by Elon Musk's support and the current political climate. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its use cases, entering commodity trading and assisting in asset recovery, but remains stable as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum. The ETF news further supports bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive ETF inflows and price breakout indicate potential for further growth, despite some technical vulnerabilities in rollups.

SOL: +0.5 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and new integrations like wrapped Bitcoin, suggesting further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase post-election and strong support from influential figures like Elon Musk, though it remains more volatile.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there's a shift away from stablecoins as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-08 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is predominantly bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic developments and significant post-election enthusiasm. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, supported by strong investor confidence and ETF-related news. Ethereum is seeing renewed interest with positive ETF inflows, although some technical vulnerabilities have been highlighted. Solana is nearing its all-time high, buoyed by increased DeFi activity and strategic integrations like Coinbase's wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has experienced a substantial price increase, largely influenced by Elon Musk's endorsement and the political climate. Tether remains stable, with its involvement in significant financial transactions underscoring its utility beyond a mere stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and strong on-chain activity, coupled with positive ETF news, suggest continued upward momentum. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some technical concerns, the positive ETF inflows and overall bullish market sentiment provide a favorable outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.6 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and strategic developments like cbBTC integration, Solana is well-positioned for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has surged significantly, the influence of external factors like Elon Musk's support adds volatility, warranting a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT in favor of higher-yielding assets."
2024-11-08 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly optimistic, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin and Dogecoin, which have recently hit new highs. Bitcoin's surge past $77,000 and Ethereum's positive ETF inflows post-election indicate strong investor confidence. However, some caution is warranted due to identified vulnerabilities in Ethereum's rollup technologies. Solana is also nearing its all-time high, supported by increased DeFi activity and integration of Bitcoin-backed tokens. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's remarkable price surge is largely attributed to Elon Musk's influence and market enthusiasm. Tether's involvement in commodity trading and asset recovery efforts highlights its expanding role in financial services.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong on-chain activity, coupled with positive news regarding ETF developments, suggest continued bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical vulnerabilities, the positive ETF inflows and overall market sentiment support a moderate bullish stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Approaching all-time highs with strong DeFi activity and integration of Bitcoin-backed tokens, indicating potential for further growth.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and strong market enthusiasm, driven by influential endorsements, suggest continued upward potential.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, holding a large stablecoin position is less favorable."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, fueled by post-election enthusiasm and increased investor confidence. Ethereum is seeing renewed interest with positive ETF inflows, although concerns about vulnerabilities in its rollup technologies may temper some optimism. Solana is nearing its all-time high, supported by increased DeFi activity and new integrations like Coinbase's wrapped Bitcoin. Dogecoin has experienced a remarkable surge, largely attributed to Elon Musk's influence and the current political climate. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its use cases, entering the commodity trading space and demonstrating its commitment to security.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and bullish momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators, make it a strong candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.4 — Despite technical concerns, the positive ETF inflows and stable price action suggest a moderate buy signal, though with some caution due to potential vulnerabilities.

SOL: +0.5 — Approaching its all-time high with strong DeFi activity and positive news from Coinbase, Solana shows potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and strong market sentiment, driven by influential endorsements, suggest continued upward potential.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities in the crypto market."
2024-11-09 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

SOL: +0.5 — Increased transaction activity and nearing all-time highs indicate strong network engagement and potential for further price gains.

2024-11-09 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin's recent surge past $77,000, bolstered by ETF inflows, suggests continued investor optimism and potential for further gains. Ethereum's price rise above $3,000, following favorable political and economic developments, indicates renewed confidence and potential for growth, especially with the upcoming Pectra upgrade. Solana is also experiencing increased activity and nearing its all-time high, reflecting strong network engagement. Dogecoin's sentiment is mixed but has potential for significant upside due to speculative interest and influential endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news regarding ETF inflows suggest continued upward momentum and investor confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive developments, such as the Mekong testnet launch, support further price appreciation, although not as strong as Bitcoin's outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased transaction activity and nearing all-time high indicate positive sentiment and growth potential, though technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, speculative interest and potential for a breakout support a moderately positive outlook, especially with influential endorsements.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, compounded by regulatory concerns surrounding Tether."
2024-11-09 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of continued strength driven by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent rally past $77,000 and the potential for further gains due to ETF inflows are particularly noteworthy. Ethereum's price has been buoyed by macroeconomic factors and upcoming network upgrades, suggesting a supportive environment for growth. Solana is experiencing heightened activity and nearing its all-time high, indicating strong network engagement. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest, particularly due to Elon Musk's influence and potential price targets. Tether's involvement in the oil trade and potential regulatory concerns add complexity to its outlook, suggesting a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong market momentum and positive ETF-related news support a bullish outlook, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price is supported by macroeconomic developments and upcoming network upgrades, indicating potential for further appreciation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's increased transaction activity and proximity to its all-time high suggest a favorable environment for growth, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by Elon Musk and potential price targets provide a moderate bullish signal, though with higher risk.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-11-09 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by bullish news and technical indicators for major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent rally past $77,000, bolstered by ETF inflows, suggests continued upward momentum. Ethereum is benefiting from a combination of macroeconomic factors and network upgrades, supporting its price above $3,000. Solana is experiencing increased transaction activity, nearing its all-time high, which reflects strong user engagement. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative interest following Elon Musk's comments and potential price targets. However, Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability and investor confidence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment from ETF inflows and positive price forecasts, coupled with consistent buy signals from technical indicators, make BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum and benefits from macroeconomic and network developments, the recent slight price decrease tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased transaction activity and nearing all-time high suggest strong network engagement and potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments and potential for price breakout supports a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2024-11-09 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by record highs and substantial ETF inflows, suggesting continued investor optimism. Ethereum has surpassed the $3,000 mark, buoyed by macroeconomic events and upcoming network upgrades, indicating renewed confidence. Solana is nearing its all-time high, with increased transaction activity highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculative interest following political developments and influential endorsements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong market momentum and positive ETF-related news suggest continued upward potential, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price surge and positive news regarding network upgrades provide a bullish outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's approach to its all-time high and increased transaction activity indicate strong network engagement, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and potential for a breakout, driven by influential endorsements, justify a moderate positive stance.

2024-11-09 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context presents a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.95. The crypto market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by strong market momentum and positive news, such as Bitcoin's potential ETF inflows and Ethereum's price surge following geopolitical events and network upgrades. Solana is also showing signs of increased activity and nearing its all-time high, while Dogecoin benefits from speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments. Tether, however, faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with positive news regarding ETF inflows and price forecasts. This, combined with a consistent buy signal from technical indicators, suggests a favorable outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum has shown significant price increases and bullish momentum, supported by positive news on network upgrades and macroeconomic factors. It remains attractive for further capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana is benefiting from increased network activity and nearing its all-time high. However, the lack of a clear buy signal from technical indicators suggests a more cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin is experiencing bullish momentum and speculative interest, particularly with Elon Musk's involvement. The potential for a price breakout supports a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market sentiment leaning bullish, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets. Additionally, regulatory concerns add to the cautious stance on Tether."
2024-11-09 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin has surpassed $77,000, with predictions of further increases due to ETF inflows, while Ethereum has gained momentum following a rate cut and Trump's election. Solana is experiencing increased network activity, nearing its all-time high, and Dogecoin is buoyed by Elon Musk's support and potential price breakout predictions. However, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability as a safe haven asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive market sentiment. On-chain activity is robust, indicating continued interest and potential for further price increases.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum following recent macroeconomic developments and technical upgrades. The price is above the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting potential for a breakout.

SOL: +0.3 — Increased transaction activity and positive news about its trading ecosystem support a moderate buy signal, though technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.5 — Strong bullish momentum and positive sentiment driven by Elon Musk's support and analyst predictions for a price breakout.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-09 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's price is supported by significant ETF inflows and optimistic analyst forecasts, while Ethereum benefits from macroeconomic developments and upcoming network upgrades. Solana is also experiencing increased activity and nearing its all-time high, indicating strong network engagement. Dogecoin is gaining traction with speculative interest fueled by Elon Musk's comments and potential price breakouts. However, Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability as a safe haven asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is in a strong uptrend with positive news about ETF inflows and bullish analyst predictions. The technical indicators support continued growth.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from macroeconomic factors and network upgrades, with bullish momentum and positive price action.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is showing increased transaction activity and is close to its all-time high, supported by strong trading tools and network engagement.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin has bullish momentum and speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments, with potential for further price increases.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is less need for stablecoin holdings, and regulatory concerns add additional risk."
2024-11-09 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-09 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin has surpassed $77,000, with expectations of further gains due to ETF inflows and bullish market momentum. Ethereum is also benefiting from bullish sentiment following a Federal Reserve rate cut and the launch of its Mekong testnet. Solana is experiencing increased network activity, pushing its price near all-time highs. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative interest following Elon Musk's comments, while Tether faces potential regulatory scrutiny despite its expansion into the oil trade. Overall, the market appears to be in a bullish phase, with risk appetite increasing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news regarding ETF inflows suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum supported by technical indicators and positive developments related to the Mekong testnet and macroeconomic factors.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased transaction activity and positive sentiment from outperforming DeFi tools support a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments and potential for a breakout, though with higher volatility risk.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-11-09 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum supported by macroeconomic factors and technological upgrades. Positive sentiment and price action justify increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Nearing all-time highs with increased network activity and strong trading ecosystem performance. Positive outlook supports further capital allocation.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news, such as Bitcoin's potential ETF inflows and Ethereum's network upgrades. Solana is also experiencing increased transactions, pushing its price near all-time highs, indicating strong network activity. Dogecoin's sentiment is buoyed by speculative news from Elon Musk, suggesting potential price increases. However, the macroeconomic context remains mixed, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggesting a stable but cautious market environment. Meanwhile, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability as a safe haven asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with positive ETF news and potential for continued price surge, supported by analyst forecasts.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum from recent price gains and network upgrades, indicating potential for further growth.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased transaction activity and nearing all-time highs suggest strong network engagement and potential price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative potential driven by Elon Musk's comments and analyst predictions, though with inherent volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — Neutral stance due to potential regulatory concerns and stable macroeconomic conditions, maintaining its role as a safe haven."
2024-11-09 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of potential upward movement driven by strong market momentum and positive news, such as ETF inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum's network upgrades. Solana is also experiencing increased network activity, pushing its price near all-time highs. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative interest following political developments and influential endorsements. However, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, with stablecoin Tether facing potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment from ETF inflows and analyst forecasts for further price increases. Positive on-chain activity supports continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum from recent price gains and network upgrades. Positive macroeconomic influences, such as the Fed rate cut, enhance investor confidence.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased transaction activity and positive news about its trading tools outperforming DeFi blue chips suggest continued strength.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by influential endorsements and potential price breakout scenarios. However, the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — Potential regulatory challenges and the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggest a rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-11-09 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility, which generally supports risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin's recent price movements and positive news regarding ETF inflows suggest continued bullish momentum, potentially driving further gains. Ethereum's price is buoyed by positive developments such as the Mekong testnet launch and macroeconomic factors like the Fed rate cut. Solana is experiencing increased network activity, nearing its all-time high, while Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments. However, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive ETF-related news indicate continued bullish sentiment, making BTC a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive macroeconomic developments and technical upgrades support Ethereum's growth potential, justifying an increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased network activity and proximity to all-time highs suggest a favorable outlook, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments and potential price breakout scenarios support a cautious increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets and potential regulatory issues, reducing exposure to USDT in favor of riskier assets is advisable."
2024-11-09 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of potential upward movement. Bitcoin continues to garner attention due to its recent price surge and positive forecasts linked to ETF inflows. Ethereum is experiencing renewed interest following macroeconomic events and network upgrades, while Solana is benefiting from increased transaction activity and robust trading tools. Dogecoin's sentiment is buoyed by speculative interest, particularly following political events and influential endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong market momentum and positive news regarding ETF inflows suggest a continued upward trajectory, making it a favorable asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish sentiment, driven by macroeconomic factors and network upgrades, supports a moderate increase in allocation, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's approach to its all-time high and increased transaction activity highlight its growing network engagement, warranting a positive allocation adjustment.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative, Dogecoin's potential for a breakout, fueled by influential endorsements and market optimism, suggests a cautious increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall bullish sentiment across other assets and potential regulatory risks, reducing exposure to Tether aligns with a strategy of reallocating capital towards higher-growth opportunities."
2024-11-09 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of potential upward momentum driven by positive news and market developments. Bitcoin's recent surge past $77,000, coupled with strong ETF inflows, suggests continued bullish sentiment.

2024-11-09 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing potential for further gains due to positive news and macroeconomic developments. Bitcoin's recent price surge past $77,000, coupled with strong ETF inflows, suggests continued bullish momentum. Ethereum's rise above $3,000 is supported by favorable macroeconomic factors and upcoming network upgrades. Solana is nearing its all-time high, driven by increased transaction activity, indicating strong network engagement. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative interest, fueled by Elon Musk's comments and potential price targets. However, concerns around Tether's involvement in the oil trade and possible sanctions introduce uncertainty, which may impact its stability.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased transaction activity and nearing all-time high suggest strong network engagement and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments and potential price targets, though technical indicators remain mixed.

2024-11-09 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum driven by positive news and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin's recent record highs and potential ETF inflows are particularly noteworthy, suggesting continued upward potential. Ethereum benefits from macroeconomic developments and upcoming network upgrades, which could enhance its scalability and efficiency. Solana is experiencing increased network activity, pushing its price near all-time highs, while Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative interest, partly due to Elon Musk's influence. Meanwhile, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong market momentum and positive news regarding ETF inflows suggest continued upward potential, making Bitcoin an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from macroeconomic developments and the upcoming Pectra upgrade support a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased transaction activity and proximity to all-time highs indicate strong network engagement, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and potential price breakout, driven by Elon Musk's influence, suggest a cautious increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — Potential regulatory risks and a shift towards riskier assets reduce the need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a decrease in allocation."
2024-11-09 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of continued upward momentum driven by positive news and investor optimism. Bitcoin's potential to reach $110,000 is bolstered by significant ETF inflows, while Ethereum benefits from macroeconomic factors like Trump's election and a Fed rate cut. Solana is experiencing increased network activity, pushing its price near all-time highs, while Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative interest following Elon Musk's comments. However, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment supported by ETF inflows and analyst predictions of further price increases. On-chain activity also indicates heightened interest.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive macroeconomic news and technical upgrades provide a bullish outlook. The recent price breakout suggests continued upward momentum.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased transaction activity and positive news regarding its trading tools support a bullish stance, though technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by Elon Musk's comments and the potential for a price breakout, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, especially given potential regulatory concerns."
2024-11-09 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, fueled by optimism from a political shift in the U.S., while Ethereum has broken above $3,000, supported by increased institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin are also experiencing strong upward momentum, reaching multi-year highs amid positive sentiment and market developments. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant adverse indicators, suggesting a favorable environment for risk assets. However, the lack of significant news for Tether (USDT) indicates a stable outlook for the stablecoin, which may be less attractive in a bullish market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with new all-time highs and significant short liquidations. Positive news and on-chain activity support further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking above $3,000 with strong institutional inflows and bullish technical indicators. Positive sentiment from Bitcoin's rally enhances its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.5 — Reaching a three-year high with positive sentiment and strong market cap growth. Potential ETF approvals add to its appeal.

DOGE: +0.4 — Significant price increase and market cap growth, driven by positive sentiment and external factors like Tesla's rally. However, lower on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm slightly.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-10 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $80,000, buoyed by optimism following a political shift perceived as crypto-friendly, and the liquidation of short positions indicates strong bullish momentum. Ethereum has also seen a substantial price increase, supported by a dramatic rise in ETF inflows, reflecting heightened institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing upward trends, with Solana reaching a three-year high and Dogecoin surpassing XRP in market capitalization. The lack of significant news for Tether suggests a stable environment for the stablecoin, with no major shifts in sentiment or market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with price surging past $80,000 and significant short position liquidations. Positive news and technical indicators support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Positive market sentiment and substantial ETF inflows indicate strong institutional interest, supporting further capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Reaching a three-year high and joining the $100B market cap club, Solana shows positive sentiment and potential for further growth.

DOGE: +0.4 — Recent price surge and overtaking of XRP in market cap, along with positive sentiment linked to Tesla, suggest moderate bullish potential.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-10 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, fueled by optimism following Donald Trump's presidential victory, which is perceived as crypto-friendly. This has led to a strong bullish momentum, with significant short position liquidations further amplifying the upward trend. Ethereum is also experiencing a positive sentiment, breaking above $3,000 and seeing a dramatic increase in ETF inflows, suggesting heightened institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin are both reaching multi-year highs, with Solana joining the $100 billion market cap club and Dogecoin surpassing XRP in market capitalization. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during volatile times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price is buoyed by positive market sentiment and substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent price surge and market cap milestone, along with positive sentiment around potential ETF approvals, support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and market cap growth, driven by positive sentiment and Tesla-related news, indicate a favorable environment.

2024-11-10 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is highly bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin reaching an all-time high following political developments and Ethereum experiencing a surge in ETF inflows. Bitcoin's rally has had a positive spillover effect on other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, all of which are experiencing strong upward momentum and investor interest. Solana and Dogecoin have reached multi-year highs, further indicating a robust risk-on environment. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, suggesting a potential capital rotation away from stablecoins as investors seek higher returns in a bullish market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.9 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong bullish momentum with significant price increases and positive news, including a new all-time high and substantial liquidation of short positions. This suggests continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum benefits from the bullish market sentiment and substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. The technical indicators also support further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's recent price surge and entry into the $100 billion market cap club, along with positive sentiment around potential ETF approvals, make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and overtaking of XRP in market capitalization highlight strong market interest, further supported by positive sentiment linked to Tesla's rally.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current risk-on sentiment and strong performance across major cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation of capital into more volatile assets."
2024-11-10 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-10 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, fueled by positive macroeconomic developments and political changes. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, supported by investor optimism following Donald Trump's presidential victory, which is perceived as crypto-friendly. Ethereum has also seen a rise above $3,000, with a notable spike in ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin have reached multi-year highs, with Solana joining the $100 billion market cap club and Dogecoin surpassing XRP in market capitalization. In this environment, the market is showing strong bullish momentum, with increased investor interest and positive sentiment across the board.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with price breaking out above $80,000, supported by positive news and high on-chain activity. The macroeconomic context also favors risk-on assets.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive market sentiment and significant ETF inflows suggest continued upward potential. The technical indicators support a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price reaching a three-year high and joining the $100 billion market cap club indicates strong investor confidence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.4 — Recent price surge and overtaking of XRP in market cap highlight increased interest and potential for continued upward movement, though with slightly less momentum than other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-10 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-10 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, fueled by optimism following a political shift in the U.S. and the liquidation of short positions, indicating strong bullish momentum. Ethereum has also benefited from the market optimism, breaking above $3,000 with substantial ETF inflows reflecting increased institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin have both reached multi-year highs, with Solana's market cap surpassing $100 billion and Dogecoin climbing due to its association with Tesla's rally and Elon Musk's influence. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by significant news and on-chain activity, suggests continued bullish potential. The political developments and liquidation of shorts further bolster confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price increase and substantial ETF inflows indicate strong institutional interest and positive sentiment, aligning with the overall bullish market environment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's achievement of a three-year high and its entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight its growing appeal and positive sentiment, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent surge and overtaking of XRP in market cap, coupled with its association with Tesla's rally, suggest a favorable environment, though with slightly less confidence compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a high USDT exposure is less attractive, prompting a reduction in allocation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is highly bullish, driven by significant developments such as Bitcoin's surge past $80,000 following a political shift in the U.S. and Ethereum's strong institutional interest reflected in ETF inflows. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced substantial price increases, reaching multi-year highs due to favorable market conditions and investor optimism. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging capital rotation into cryptocurrencies. The absence of significant news for Tether suggests a stable environment for the stablecoin, typically used as a safe haven in volatile markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by both technical indicators and positive news, such as the Trump victory and liquidation of short positions, suggesting continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from increased institutional interest and positive market sentiment, as evidenced by the ETF inflow spike and its price breaking above $3,000, aligning with the broader crypto rally.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price and market cap have reached significant highs, supported by positive sentiment and potential ETF approvals, indicating strong investor confidence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent surge in price and market cap, along with its overtaking of XRP, reflects strong market interest and potential upside, although it remains more volatile compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings as a safe haven."
2024-11-10 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is strongly bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. This optimism is fueled by recent political developments, such as Donald Trump's presidential victory, which is perceived as crypto-friendly, and the anticipation of potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, leading to a substantial liquidation of short positions, while Ethereum has broken above $3,000 with significant ETF inflows. Solana and Dogecoin have also reached multi-year highs, reflecting heightened investor interest and positive sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong bullish momentum with a new all-time high, supported by positive news and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. The liquidation of short positions further underscores the market's confidence.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's price surge and significant ETF inflows indicate robust institutional interest and positive sentiment, aligning with the overall bullish market trend.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's market cap surpassing $100 billion and its price reaching a three-year high highlight strong investor confidence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and its move to become the seventh-largest cryptocurrency reflect growing market interest, likely driven by external factors like Tesla's rally.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets to capture potential gains."
2024-11-10 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is strongly bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, reaching all-time highs due to optimism around a potentially crypto-friendly political environment and the liquidation of short positions, indicating strong bullish momentum. Ethereum has also seen a substantial price increase, bolstered by a dramatic rise in ETF inflows, suggesting heightened institutional interest. Solana's market cap has surpassed $100 billion, with its price reaching a three-year high, fueled by positive sentiment and potential ETF approvals. Dogecoin has experienced a notable price surge, overtaking XRP in market capitalization, driven by attention on Elon Musk and a rally in Tesla's stock. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, including the all-time high and liquidation of short positions, make it a highly attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's price increase and significant ETF inflow spike indicate robust institutional interest, supporting a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price reaching a three-year high and joining the $100 billion market cap club highlight its growing appeal, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's surge in market cap and price, driven by external factors like Tesla's rally, suggest continued positive momentum, though slightly less compelling than the top three assets.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent as capital rotates into higher-yielding assets."
2024-11-10 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-10 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-10 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price surges across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's rally past $80,000, supported by a favorable political climate and the liquidation of short positions, indicates strong bullish momentum. Ethereum's price rise above $3,000 and substantial ETF inflows highlight growing institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced notable gains, reaching multi-year highs amid positive sentiment and market optimism. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during volatile market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and on-chain activity, suggests continued bullishness. The political climate and liquidation of short positions further strengthen its appeal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from increased institutional interest and positive market sentiment, although technical indicators show mixed signals. The overall bullish environment supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's significant price increase and market cap growth indicate strong investor confidence. The potential for ETF approvals adds to its attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's price surge and market cap growth, driven by external factors like Tesla's rally, suggest continued interest. However, its volatility warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness in a bullish market."
2024-11-10 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, reaching a new all-time high, largely due to investor optimism following Donald Trump's presidential victory and expectations of a more crypto-friendly administration. This has led to the liquidation of a substantial amount of short positions, indicating strong bullish momentum. Ethereum has also seen positive movement, breaking above $3,000, supported by a massive spike in ETF inflows, highlighting increased institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing significant price increases, reaching multi-year highs, fueled by positive sentiment and favorable market conditions. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with new all-time highs and positive news sentiment. High transaction activity and liquidation of shorts further support the upward trend.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive price movement and significant ETF inflows indicate strong institutional interest, although technical indicators are mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price reaching a three-year high and joining the $100B market cap club signals strong market confidence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.4 — Recent price surge and overtaking XRP in market cap, combined with positive sentiment linked to Tesla, suggest continued upward potential.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall bullish market sentiment, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for holding USDT."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, fueled by optimism surrounding a potentially more crypto-friendly U.S. administration and the liquidation of short positions, indicating strong bullish momentum. Ethereum has also broken above $3,000, supported by increased institutional interest and ETF inflows. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing significant rallies, reaching multi-year highs due to positive sentiment and market dynamics. In contrast, USDT remains stable without significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment, with Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs and significant short liquidations, suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive market sentiment and substantial ETF inflows indicate growing institutional interest, although technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price and market cap have reached multi-year highs, supported by positive sentiment and potential ETF approvals, indicating strong upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's recent surge and overtaking of XRP in market capitalization, along with positive sentiment linked to Tesla, suggest continued interest and potential gains.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-10 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, following positive macroeconomic developments such as Donald Trump's presidential victory, which is perceived as crypto-friendly. Bitcoin has reached an all-time high above $80,000, leading to the liquidation of short positions and indicating strong bullish momentum. Ethereum has also broken above $3,000, with substantial inflows into Ethereum-focused ETFs, highlighting increased institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin have seen significant price surges, reaching multi-year highs, fueled by optimism around potential ETF approvals and market dynamics involving influential figures like Elon Musk. Despite these bullish trends, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and stable traditional asset prices, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and significant on-chain activity, makes it a priority for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge and substantial ETF inflows indicate growing institutional interest, warranting a moderately positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price reaching a three-year high and joining the $100 billion market cap club suggests strong market confidence, justifying a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Dogecoin's rise to become the seventh-largest cryptocurrency and its price peak amid Tesla's rally suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a slight reduction in USDT exposure."
2024-11-10 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-10 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $80,000, fueled by optimism following a political shift perceived as crypto-friendly, and a large liquidation of short positions indicates strong bullish momentum. Ethereum has also broken above $3,000, supported by a dramatic increase in ETF inflows, reflecting heightened institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing significant price increases, reaching multi-year highs, driven by positive sentiment and market dynamics. In contrast, there is no significant news for Tether, indicating a stable environment for the stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with new all-time highs and significant short position liquidations, suggesting continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive sentiment and increased institutional interest through ETF inflows support further gains, though momentum is less pronounced than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong price performance and market cap growth, reaching multi-year highs, indicate continued investor confidence and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and market cap growth, driven by external factors like Tesla's rally, suggest moderate bullish sentiment, though less strong than other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need to hold USDT."
2024-11-10 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, supported by a potentially more crypto-friendly regulatory environment following the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing strong upward momentum, with Ethereum hitting a three-month high and Solana achieving a two-year high. Dogecoin has seen a notable surge, outperforming Bitcoin amid speculative trading. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand, indicating robust market liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's new all-time high and positive regulatory news suggest strong bullish momentum. Despite the lack of a bullish MACD signal, the overall sentiment and trend are favorable.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price increase and accumulation addresses reaching $78 billion reflect strong investor confidence. The recent surge aligns with broader market gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's impressive price performance and market cap growth signal strong investor interest. The trend and market sentiment are highly supportive.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and outperformance of Bitcoin indicate strong speculative interest, although its inherent volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With the bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-11-11 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies following the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin has reached a record high, and Ethereum has hit a three-month peak, reflecting strong investor confidence and positive market sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced substantial gains, with Solana joining the $100 billion market cap club and Dogecoin outperforming Bitcoin amid speculative trading. Tether's recent minting of additional USDT indicates a response to increased demand and potential future issuance needs.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong upward momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity, suggest a continued bullish trend. The positive news environment further reinforces confidence in BTC's potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge and accumulation address growth indicate strong investor confidence. However, technical indicators are mixed, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's significant price increase and market cap growth highlight strong investor interest. Despite the lack of bullish momentum signals, the positive news and market cap milestone support a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance of Bitcoin suggest renewed investor enthusiasm. While speculative, the positive momentum and news justify a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets. The minting of additional USDT suggests sufficient supply to meet demand, reducing the need to hold excess stablecoin reserves."
2024-11-11 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, following a favorable macroeconomic environment post-U.S. election. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong investor confidence, while Ethereum and Solana have also experienced notable price surges, reflecting renewed interest and accumulation. Dogecoin has shown impressive gains, outperforming Bitcoin, which suggests speculative trading activity. Tether's recent minting of additional USDT indicates a strategic move to meet increased demand and facilitate liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by a new all-time high and increased on-chain activity, suggests continued bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic backdrop and recent news further bolster confidence in BTC.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge to a three-month high and significant accumulation indicate positive sentiment, although technical indicators remain mixed. The overall market environment supports a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive price increase and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight strong investor interest. Despite mixed momentum signals, the broader market rally supports a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance relative to Bitcoin suggest speculative interest, warranting a cautious but positive allocation given its volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's minting activity suggests robust demand, the overall bullish market sentiment favors capital rotation out of stablecoins and into riskier assets."
2024-11-11 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent price surge and entry into the $100B market cap club highlight strong investor interest. Despite some technical resistance, the overall sentiment remains positive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance relative to Bitcoin suggest speculative interest, though its inherent volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets to capture potential gains."
2024-11-11 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have reached new highs. Bitcoin's recent surge past $87,000, attributed to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment post-election, has triggered substantial losses for short traders, indicating strong upward momentum.

Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand, maintaining its role as a stable liquidity provider.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by both technical indicators and positive news, suggests continued bullish sentiment. The recent all-time high and increased on-chain activity further reinforce the potential for gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge and accumulation indicate positive sentiment, although technical indicators remain mixed. The overall market rally supports a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's recent price surge and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight strong investor interest. Despite mixed technical signals, the positive news supports a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent price increase and outperformance relative to Bitcoin suggest speculative interest, though its inherent volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is less need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a slight reduction in USDT exposure to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price surges in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have reached new highs following positive macroeconomic developments such as a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment post-election. Bitcoin's record high has triggered losses for short traders, indicating strong upward momentum. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing strong investor interest, with Ethereum accumulation addresses reaching substantial levels and Solana joining the $100 billion market cap club. Dogecoin has seen a speculative rally, outperforming Bitcoin in recent gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply, indicating ongoing demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, record high, and positive news sentiment suggest continued bullishness. The market data supports a buy signal with bullish momentum and potential breakout patterns.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, Ethereum's accumulation and positive news sentiment provide a supportive backdrop. The technicals are mixed, but the broader market environment favors a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's recent price surge and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight its strong performance. The technicals show a consistent buy signal, supporting a positive allocation score.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance of Bitcoin indicate speculative interest. However, its high volatility warrants a more cautious approach, resulting in a moderate positive score.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-11 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have reached new highs. This optimism is fueled by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment following the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin's surge to a record high and Ethereum's climb to a three-month peak reflect strong investor confidence. Solana has also joined the $100 billion market cap club, indicating its growing prominence. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has experienced a speculative rally, outperforming Bitcoin in recent gains. Tether's recent minting of additional USDT suggests ongoing demand for stablecoins, although the broader market trend indicates a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, record highs, and positive news sentiment suggest continued bullishness. The macroeconomic context supports risk-on behavior, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price increases and strong accumulation signals, technical indicators are mixed. However, positive market sentiment and accumulation trends warrant a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's significant price increase and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight its growing appeal. The positive news and technical signals support a bullish allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent surge and outperformance against Bitcoin indicate speculative interest. While volatile, the current sentiment justifies a cautious bullish position.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market's risk appetite increasing, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-11 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have reached new highs. Bitcoin's surge past $87,000 and Ethereum's three-month peak reflect strong investor confidence and a favorable macroeconomic environment post-U.S. presidential election. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced notable gains, with Solana joining the $100 billion market cap club and Dogecoin outperforming Bitcoin amid speculative trading. Tether's recent minting of additional USDT indicates ongoing demand for stablecoins, although the broader market trend suggests a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by a new all-time high and positive regulatory expectations, makes it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, Ethereum's price surge and accumulation by investors signal a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's recent price highs and market cap growth, along with positive investor sentiment, suggest continued strength, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has shown significant gains, its speculative nature and recent volatility suggest a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a market shift towards riskier assets, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a hedge against potential market corrections."
2024-11-11 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's rise to a three-month high and strong accumulation signals indicate positive sentiment, though technical indicators remain mixed. The overall market environment supports a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive price performance and market cap milestone highlight strong investor interest. Despite mixed technical signals, the positive news flow justifies a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent surge and outperformance of Bitcoin suggest speculative interest, though its inherent volatility warrants a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is justified by current enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite Tether's active minting, the overall bullish market sentiment reduces the need for stablecoin exposure. Maintaining a neutral position allows flexibility to capitalize on potential market shifts."
2024-11-11 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price surges across major cryptocurrencies following the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial gains, reflecting strong investor interest and positive sentiment. Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin in recent speculative trading, highlighting its volatility and appeal. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand, indicating ongoing liquidity needs in the market. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong buy signals from trend indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — While Ethereum lacks a clear buy signal from trend indicators, its recent price surge and strong accumulation activity indicate positive sentiment and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's significant price increase and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight its growing importance and investor interest, supporting a positive allocation score.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite its speculative nature, Dogecoin's recent outperformance and price surge warrant a moderate positive score, though caution is advised due to its volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is no strong incentive to hold stablecoins, but maintaining some exposure for liquidity purposes is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, fueled by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment following the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial gains, with Ethereum reaching a three-month high and Solana joining the $100 billion market cap club. Dogecoin has experienced a notable surge, outperforming Bitcoin amid speculative trading. Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity, with recent minting activities indicating strong demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and record high price, coupled with positive regulatory expectations, make it a highly attractive asset for capital allocation.

**ETH: +0.5** — Despite lacking a strong technical buy signal, Ethereum's price surge and significant accumulation activity suggest positive sentiment and potential for further gains.

**SOL: +0.9** — Solana's impressive price performance and market cap milestone indicate strong investor interest and potential for continued growth, making it a top priority for allocation.

**DOGE: +0.3** — Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance relative to Bitcoin highlight its speculative appeal, though its volatility warrants a more cautious approach.

**USDT: -0.4** — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on bullish market conditions."
2024-11-11 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Solana, following the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, spurred by expectations of a favorable regulatory environment, while Solana has joined the $100 billion market cap club, reflecting heightened investor interest. Ethereum and Dogecoin have also experienced notable gains, with Ethereum reaching a three-month high and Dogecoin outperforming Bitcoin amid speculative trading. Tether's recent minting of additional USDT suggests strong demand for liquidity, although the broader market's risk appetite appears to be increasing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and positive regulatory expectations support a strong buy signal, despite recent volatility and short-seller losses.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge and accumulation address growth indicate positive sentiment and investor confidence, warranting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana's significant price increase and market cap milestone highlight strong momentum and investor interest, justifying a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen a price surge, its speculative nature and volatility suggest a cautious approach, but still a positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-11-11 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, fueled by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment following the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing strong upward trends, with Ethereum hitting a three-month high and Solana joining the $100 billion market cap club. Dogecoin has seen a notable surge, outperforming Bitcoin in recent gains, indicating speculative trading activity. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand, maintaining its role as a stablecoin in a volatile market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators suggest continued upward potential. The positive news environment further supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, Ethereum's price increase and accumulation by investors indicate a positive outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's significant price increase and bullish momentum, coupled with its entry into the $100 billion market cap club, make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has experienced a recent price surge, its speculative nature and lack of strong technical signals suggest a cautious but positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — As the market shows bullish tendencies, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent to allow for potential capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-11 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has shown volatility, its recent price surge and outperformance of Bitcoin suggest potential for further gains, though with caution due to its speculative nature.

USDT: 0.0 — Although Tether remains a stable option, the current bullish market environment reduces the need for stablecoin holdings, leading to a neutral stance."
2024-11-11 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies following the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, supported by expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment. Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial gains, reflecting strong investor confidence and accumulation. Dogecoin has experienced a speculative rally, outperforming Bitcoin in recent gains. Meanwhile, Tether has been active in minting additional USDT to meet demand, indicating ongoing interest in stablecoins despite the bullish market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and record-high prices, coupled with positive news, make it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent price surge and accumulation activity suggest a positive outlook, though not as strong as Bitcoin's momentum.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive price performance and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight its growing appeal and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite its speculative nature, Dogecoin's recent outperformance and price surge warrant a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish market environment, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent as capital rotates into more volatile assets with higher return potential."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies following favorable macroeconomic conditions and a post-election rally. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum and Solana have also hit significant price milestones, indicating strong investor confidence and renewed interest. Dogecoin has seen a speculative surge, outperforming Bitcoin in recent gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand, reflecting its role as a liquidity provider in the market. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, supports risk-on sentiment, which is conducive to further capital inflows into cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong bullish momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity and positive news, make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent price surge and accumulation by investors indicate positive sentiment, though its momentum is slightly less pronounced than Bitcoin's.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive price performance and market cap growth, along with strong technical indicators, suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite its speculative nature, Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance relative to Bitcoin warrant a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market in a bullish phase, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-11 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies following the U.S. presidential election, which has been perceived as potentially crypto-friendly. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and Ethereum has hit a three-month peak, both indicating strong investor confidence and market momentum. Solana has also achieved a two-year high, joining the $100 billion market cap club, while Dogecoin has surged significantly, outperforming Bitcoin in recent gains. Tether has been active in minting additional USDT to meet demand, reflecting ongoing liquidity needs in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's record high and strong bullish momentum, coupled with favorable news, suggest continued upward potential. The recent surge in price and on-chain activity supports a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price increase and accumulation indicate positive sentiment and investor confidence. The breakout above the Bollinger Bands further supports a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong price performance and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight its growing appeal. The consistent bullish momentum and positive news support increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant price surge and outperformance of Bitcoin suggest increased speculative interest. The bullish momentum and recent news support a positive allocation, though with caution due to its volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish market conditions, there is less need for stablecoin exposure. However, maintaining a neutral position is prudent to manage potential volatility and liquidity needs."
2024-11-11 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-11 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-11 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant price increases across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, fueled by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment following the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing strong upward momentum, with Ethereum reaching a three-month high and Solana hitting a two-year high. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has seen a notable surge, outperforming Bitcoin in recent speculative trading. Tether's recent minting of additional USDT suggests preparation for increased demand, although its role remains largely stable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news sentiment, including a new all-time high, indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price surge and accumulation by investors reflect strong confidence, supporting a positive allocation despite slightly mixed technical signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's significant price increase and entry into the $100 billion market cap club highlight its growing appeal, justifying a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite its volatility, Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance relative to Bitcoin suggest potential for further gains, though with caution.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in the current bullish market, serving as a liquidity reserve rather than a growth asset."
2024-11-11 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, driven by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment following the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial gains, supported by increased investor interest and accumulation. Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin in recent gains, reflecting speculative trading activity. Meanwhile, Tether has increased its supply to meet demand, indicating ongoing liquidity needs in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and record-high levels, combined with bullish on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential. Positive news regarding regulatory expectations further supports this view.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price increase and accumulation trends indicate strong investor confidence. Despite slight recent price fluctuations, overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price hitting a two-year high and surpassing a $100 billion market cap reflects strong market interest and momentum, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and outperformance against Bitcoin highlight its speculative appeal, though its inherent volatility suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's increased supply indicates liquidity provision, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining stablecoin exposure at neutral levels."
2024-11-11 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana reaching new highs. Bitcoin has surged past $87,000, driven by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment following the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum and Solana have also seen significant gains, reflecting strong investor confidence and accumulation. Dogecoin has experienced a speculative rally, outperforming Bitcoin in recent gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet market demand, indicating ongoing utility and liquidity in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, record high prices, and positive news sentiment suggest continued bullishness. The asset's recent performance and macroeconomic context support further capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price surge and accumulation indicate strong investor confidence. While not as strong as Bitcoin's rally, the positive sentiment and technical indicators warrant increased exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's recent price surge and market cap milestone highlight its growing prominence. The bullish trend and investor interest justify a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite its speculative nature, Dogecoin's recent outperformance and increased investor enthusiasm suggest potential for further gains, albeit with higher risk.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market in a bullish phase, there is less need to hold stablecoins. Capital can be rotated into more volatile assets to capture potential upside."
2024-11-11 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
