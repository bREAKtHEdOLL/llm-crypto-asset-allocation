2024-08-09 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum and a significant price rebound, suggesting renewed trader confidence. Ethereum, however, is underperforming relative to the broader market recovery, with concerns about its price action and potential decline. Solana is benefiting from positive developments, including the launch of a new ETF in Brazil and clarification on token supply concerns, which may bolster investor confidence. Dogecoin is facing declining interest and value, as attention shifts to other meme coins. Tether remains stable, with significant movements to exchanges indicating active market participation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price rebound and positive market sentiment suggest a favorable environment for capital allocation. The recent surge and recovery indicate potential for further gains.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution. The asset may face continued pressure, making it less attractive for allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the Solana ETF and clarification on supply concerns support a bullish outlook. The asset's stability and institutional interest make it a viable candidate for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's declining interest and value, coupled with a lack of positive developments, suggest a neutral stance. Current market conditions do not favor increased exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of recovery and increased risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a significant recovery, gaining nearly 12% as it rebounds from recent declines. This has boosted confidence across the crypto market, lifting the total market capitalization above $2.1 trillion. However, Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, facing bearish sentiment despite the broader market recovery. Solana is experiencing positive developments with institutional interest, evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is struggling with declining investor interest and negative sentiment. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment support further gains. The recent price surge and recovery signal a bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment suggest a cautious approach. No current holdings to reduce.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF launch provide a supportive backdrop. Current holdings warrant maintaining a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent declines and fading interest, there is no current exposure to reduce. Neutral stance maintained.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of recovery, there is a potential for capital rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-09 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery rally, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing around $61,500. This rebound has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, showing signs of weakness and underwhelming price action. Solana is experiencing positive developments, such as the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, which indicates growing institutional interest. Dogecoin, however, is facing declining investor interest and value losses, while Tether is witnessing increased market activity with significant transfers to exchanges, suggesting heightened trading interest.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, with significant price recovery and increased on-chain activity, suggest continued strength.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF, along with generally bullish technical indicators, support a moderately positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.2 — Given the current holding of zero, the negative sentiment and declining interest in Dogecoin suggest avoiding entry at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-09 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since early 2022. This recovery has bolstered trader confidence and lifted the broader crypto market. However, Ethereum has underperformed relative to other major assets, reflecting a more cautious outlook among investors. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, although concerns about token supply were addressed by Binance. Dogecoin continues to face declining interest and value, while Tether's increased activity on exchanges suggests heightened market engagement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive momentum signals, coupled with supportive news, indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment suggest a cautious approach is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and clarification on supply concerns provide a positive backdrop for Solana, despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: 0.0 — Continued decline in interest and value, with no positive catalysts, suggests maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — The market's risk appetite is increasing, as indicated by the movement of USDT to exchanges, suggesting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-09 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong recovery, rallying nearly 12% and stabilizing above $61,000. This rebound is part of a broader market recovery, lifting the total crypto market capitalization above $2.1 trillion. Ethereum, however, is underperforming, with analysts expressing concerns over its weak price action relative to other major assets. Solana has seen mixed news, with concerns over token supply being addressed by Binance and the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, indicating growing institutional interest. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest, with sharp value losses and attention shifting to other meme coins. Tether remains stable, with significant USDT transfers to exchanges suggesting increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive market sentiment, coupled with bullish technical indicators, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and clarification on supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop, although technical signals are mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and negative sentiment, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, there is a potential for capital rotation out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-09 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong recovery, rebounding significantly after recent declines. This has bolstered trader confidence and lifted the broader crypto market. Ethereum, however, is underperforming despite the market recovery, facing bearish sentiment due to its weak price action. Solana is gaining attention with institutional interest, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, while Dogecoin continues to struggle with declining investor interest. Tether remains stable but is experiencing increased activity, as indicated by large transfers to exchanges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news and technical indicators, suggesting a favorable environment for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news about supply concerns being addressed provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral position on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment in the broader crypto market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-08-09 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, having recently experienced a significant rally. This has helped lift the broader crypto market, although some assets like Ethereum are underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Solana is gaining institutional interest, as evidenced by the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, which could bolster its appeal. Dogecoin, however, is facing declining investor interest, and its value has been dropping. Meanwhile, Tether is seeing increased activity, with substantial amounts being moved to exchanges, indicating heightened market engagement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum. The recent rally indicates renewed trader confidence, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite Ethereum's technical buy signals, its underperformance and negative news sentiment relative to other major assets suggest a neutral stance is prudent for now.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive developments such as the new ETF launch in Brazil support a moderately bullish outlook, despite the lack of strong momentum signals.

DOGE: -0.2 — With declining investor interest and negative news sentiment, reducing exposure is advisable, although current holdings are zero, so no action is needed.

USDT: -0.3 — The increased movement of USDT to exchanges suggests a shift in risk appetite, warranting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-09 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong rebound and leading the crypto market recovery. Bitcoin's price surge and stabilization above $61,000 have boosted trader confidence, while Ethereum struggles with underperformance despite the broader market recovery.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and stabilization, coupled with positive market sentiment and on-chain activity, suggest a favorable outlook for further gains.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite underperformance, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, and it may benefit from the overall market recovery, albeit with caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of positive momentum and declining investor interest suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to allocate capital.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of recovery, there is a potential rotation out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong rebound and renewed trader confidence, as evidenced by its recent price surge and increased on-chain activity. Ethereum, however, is underperforming relative to the broader crypto recovery, with analysts expressing concerns over its weak price action. Solana is experiencing positive developments with institutional interest, as seen with the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, although there are concerns about token supply inflation. Dogecoin is facing a decline in investor interest and value, while Tether is witnessing heightened market activity with significant transfers to exchanges, indicating potential capital movement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price recovery and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook. The recent news of a significant price rally further supports a bullish stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment from analysts warrant caution. The lack of strong momentum signals suggests a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest, as indicated by the launch of a Solana ETF, and clarification on token supply concerns provide a positive outlook, justifying increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — The movement of large amounts of USDT to exchanges suggests potential capital rotation into riskier assets, warranting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-09 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a rebound after a period of decline. Bitcoin's recent surge, marking its strongest rally since February 2022, has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed relative to other major assets. Solana has seen positive developments with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, signaling growing institutional interest. However, Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and value losses, while Tether's increased exchange activity suggests heightened market engagement but also a potential shift in capital allocation preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed trader confidence, coupled with positive news, suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The consistent buy signals from trend indicators support this outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment in the news warrant a neutral stance. The lack of bullish momentum signals further supports holding rather than increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding institutional interest and the resolution of supply concerns, along with a slight price increase, indicate a favorable environment for Solana. The ETF launch in Brazil is a particularly bullish signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and negative sentiment dominating the news, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases with Bitcoin's rally, there is a slight preference to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, although maintaining a significant cash position remains prudent given market volatility."
2024-08-09 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a notable recovery, surging nearly 12% and stabilizing around $61,500. This recovery has bolstered trader confidence, although Ethereum has underperformed, dropping significantly amid broader market gains. Solana has seen mixed developments, with institutional interest highlighted by a new ETF launch, but concerns about token supply have been addressed. Dogecoin is experiencing declining interest and value, while Tether's increased exchange activity suggests heightened market engagement. The macroeconomic context shows stable interest rates and a relatively high volatility index, which may influence risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong recovery momentum and positive news sentiment, with Bitcoin leading the market rebound. On-chain activity is stable, supporting further gains.

ETH: -0.3 — Underperformance and negative sentiment relative to other assets suggest caution. Despite buy signals, the recent sell-off and weak price action warrant a conservative stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest via the new ETF and resolved supply concerns provide a positive outlook. Although technical signals are neutral, the news supports potential upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Declining investor interest and negative sentiment offset any technical buy signals. No current holdings justify a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Increased market activity and capital rotation into riskier assets suggest reducing stablecoin exposure to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-09 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong rebound and leading the crypto market recovery. Bitcoin's recent rally has boosted trader confidence, although Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, raising concerns about its short-term prospects. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, while Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and sharp value losses. Tether remains stable, with significant inflows to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment relative to other assets suggest a cautious approach, maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the new ETF provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite negative sentiment and declining interest, current holdings are zero, so no reduction is possible; maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since early 2022. This has helped lift the broader crypto market, although Ethereum is underperforming, raising concerns about its relative weakness. Solana is seeing positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, despite some concerns about token supply. Dogecoin faces declining investor interest, with a shift towards other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations, and a substantial amount of USDT has been moved to exchanges, indicating increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent strong rally and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment highlight potential downside risks, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and the launch of a Solana ETF provide a positive outlook, despite technical indicators not yet signaling a strong buy.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and no current holdings, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a stable option, the increased market activity and positive sentiment in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-09 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery, having surged nearly 12% recently. This rebound has bolstered confidence in the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has notably underperformed, raising concerns about its relative weakness. Solana has seen mixed signals, with institutional interest growing despite concerns over token supply. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest, while Tether is actively expanding its operations, indicating robust market activity and liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment highlight caution, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, institutional interest and positive news about the ETF in Brazil provide a slight bullish signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and no current holdings, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of mixed market conditions and Ethereum's weakness, maintaining liquidity in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-09 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a rebound, marking a significant single-day rally. This recovery has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, raising concerns about its short-term outlook. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest growing, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is experiencing a decline in investor interest, with attention shifting to other meme coins. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news flow suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent price surge and increased market confidence support a positive allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment in the news suggest caution. The lack of bullish technical signals further justifies a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF provide a supportive backdrop. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate positive score.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, Dogecoin remains a neutral hold, especially given the absence of current holdings.

USDT: -0.5 — As market conditions improve and risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected, justifying a reduced allocation in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-09 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery rally, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing after a strong rebound. This recovery has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, continuing to show weakness relative to other major assets. Solana has seen mixed signals, with concerns over token supply addressed by Binance and the launch of a new ETF in Brazil indicating institutional interest. Dogecoin is facing declining interest and value, while Tether remains active, with significant transfers to exchanges suggesting increased market activity. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility and stable interest rates, which may support a gradual risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news flow suggest renewed confidence and potential for further gains. The recent rally and stabilization near key levels are encouraging for continued capital allocation.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution. The lack of strong technical signals suggests maintaining a conservative stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest, as evidenced by the new ETF, and the resolution of supply concerns provide a moderate boost. However, technical indicators remain neutral, suggesting a cautious increase in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases with Bitcoin's recovery, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong recovery, rebounding sharply and regaining trader confidence. This is reflected in the recent news of Bitcoin's significant rally, which has helped lift the broader crypto market. However, Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, with concerns about its weak price action. Solana is gaining attention with institutional interest, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, although there were initial concerns about token supply. Dogecoin is facing a decline in investor interest, with attention shifting to other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable outlook, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment in the news warrant caution, despite the broader market recovery.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and the launch of a Solana ETF are positive indicators, although technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-09 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since early 2022. This recovery has lifted the total crypto market capitalization above $2.1 trillion, signaling renewed trader confidence. However, Ethereum has underperformed, facing skepticism from analysts due to its weak price action relative to other major assets. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, while Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest. Tether remains stable, with significant movements to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent surge in price and market confidence supports increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment, as highlighted by analysts, suggest caution. Current technicals do not support a strong buy, warranting reduced exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest, as evidenced by the new ETF launch, and clarification on supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent declines and fading investor interest, there is no strong signal for a directional change. Maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a shift in capital from stablecoins to riskier assets, suggesting a reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-09 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery rally, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing after a sharp decline earlier in the week. This rebound has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, facing criticism for weak price action. Solana has seen positive developments with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil and clarification from Binance on supply concerns, which may bolster investor confidence. Dogecoin, however, is struggling with declining interest and sharp losses. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the Solana ETF and supply clarification, along with stable technical indicators, support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and negative sentiment around Dogecoin, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases with the market recovery, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to reallocate capital to more promising assets."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, suggesting renewed trader confidence. Despite this, Ethereum has underperformed, indicating potential investor caution or rotation into other assets. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest, while Dogecoin faces declining interest. Tether remains active, with substantial transfers to exchanges, possibly indicating increased trading activity or demand for liquidity. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility and stable traditional asset prices, which may support a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable environment for continued gains, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding supply concerns position Solana as a relatively attractive asset, suggesting potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent given its recent performance.

USDT: -0.3 — While USDT remains a stable asset, the positive market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-09 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable rebound, suggesting a potential recovery in the broader crypto market. Bitcoin's recent surge has lifted market confidence, although Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, raising concerns about its short-term prospects. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, which could bolster its appeal. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is facing declining interest and value, overshadowed by other meme coins. Tether remains stable, with significant movements to exchanges indicating active market participation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution, suggesting a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news developments provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, indicating potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no current holdings, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.4 — The market's risk-on sentiment and capital rotation into more volatile assets suggest a reduced need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-10 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a mixed environment with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing subdued momentum with BTC showing resilience but remaining within a tight range, while ETH faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. SOL has seen a notable whale transfer to an exchange, which could signal potential liquidation. DOGE lacks significant news or activity, and USDT continues to grow its market cap, reflecting its role as a stable haven amidst market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience in holding its range suggests a cautious optimism. The lack of significant bearish news supports a slight positive bias.

ETH: -0.3 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The recent price pressure warrants reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — The whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure. However, bullish momentum signals provide some support, leading to a slightly negative stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. Its low on-chain activity does not provide a compelling case for allocation changes.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current environment of mixed signals and potential risk aversion, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent. Its growing market cap and stability offer a safe haven amidst uncertainty."
2024-08-10 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be cautiously neutral with a slight bearish undertone. Bitcoin is showing resilience despite subdued momentum and a recent decline, indicating a consolidation phase. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana has experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential selling pressure. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news, while Tether's market cap has reached a new high amid legal disputes, indicating its continued role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and consolidation suggest stability, warranting a modest positive allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure from market makers and lack of bullish signals suggest caution, leading to a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to an exchange indicates potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious approach despite bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market uncertainties and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2024-08-10 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin remains relatively stable, trading within a narrow range after a recent rally, but lacks strong momentum. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana is experiencing potential distribution pressure following a large whale transfer to an exchange, indicating possible liquidation. Dogecoin has no significant news, maintaining its status quo. Tether continues to grow its market cap, reaching a new all-time high, but faces legal challenges that could impact sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's stability and resilience in price suggest a modest preference for holding, given its role as a market anchor.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure from market makers and lack of bullish signals indicate a cautious stance, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange suggests potential selling pressure, advising a slight reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and USDT's increasing market cap, a slight preference for holding more stablecoin exposure is prudent to manage risk."
2024-08-10 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with the 10-Year Treasury Yield and crude oil prices showing no significant fluctuations. However, the elevated CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) suggests a degree of market uncertainty, which may influence risk-averse behavior. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is holding steady after a recent rally, but overall market momentum is subdued. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, while Solana faces potential selling pressure from a large whale transfer. Dogecoin remains quiet with no significant news, and Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst legal disputes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience in maintaining its price range suggests a slight preference for holding, given its role as a market stabilizer.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell-off pressures and lack of positive momentum signal a need to reduce exposure, especially given the minimal current holdings.

SOL: -0.3 — Potential distribution from a whale transfer and lack of strong buy signals warrant a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintain a neutral stance on DOGE.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the elevated market uncertainty and strong demand for stablecoins, increasing USDT exposure is prudent to hedge against potential volatility."
2024-08-10 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment indicates a mixed sentiment with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. Bitcoin is showing resilience with steady prices despite subdued market momentum. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has negatively impacted its price. Solana has experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, potentially indicating a sell-off or redistribution. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its market. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, but it is also facing legal challenges, which could introduce some uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a lack of strong momentum, BTC's resilience and stable price range suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its role as a hedge in uncertain conditions.

ETH: -0.5 — The significant sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to ETH, especially given the small current holding.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to an exchange could indicate potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious approach despite some bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintain a neutral stance on DOGE.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainties and mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-08-10 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 20.48, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index at 103.14. Bitcoin shows resilience despite subdued market momentum, maintaining its price range after a recent rally. Ethereum faces pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs, while Solana experiences potential distribution signals from large whale transfers. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, and Tether continues to grow its market cap, despite legal disputes. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a mix of stability in Bitcoin and Tether, pressure on Ethereum, and potential distribution in Solana.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin shows resilience with stable price action and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious buy signal in a consolidating market.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell-off pressure from market-makers and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Whale transfer to exchanges suggests potential distribution, which could lead to downward pressure on price.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintain a neutral stance on Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential for further volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some signs of bullish momentum emerging, particularly in Ethereum and Solana, as indicated by their recent price increases and technical indicators. Bitcoin remains relatively stable, trading within a narrow range, reflecting subdued market momentum. Ethereum has faced significant sell-off pressure from market makers, which has impacted its price negatively. Solana has experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation. Dogecoin has shown some bullish momentum in the latest hour, but lacks significant news to drive further movement. Meanwhile, Tether has reached a new all-time high in market cap, but faces legal challenges, which could affect its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin's stability and resilience in its current range suggest a moderate buy signal, though overall market momentum remains subdued.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the heavy market-maker sell-off and lack of significant news support a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — The bullish momentum and recent price increase are positive, but the large whale transfer to an exchange warrants caution.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a slight positive outlook, though lacking significant news.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed market conditions and legal disputes, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as it provides stability amidst uncertainty."
2024-08-10 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic with some mixed signals. Bitcoin shows resilience with its price holding steady despite subdued market momentum, suggesting a consolidation phase. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, indicating potential liquidation, which could weigh on its price. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows some bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, but legal issues with Celsius could introduce some uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin's steady price and high on-chain activity suggest resilience, but the lack of strong bullish momentum tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent heavy sell-offs by market makers and a significant price drop create a bearish outlook, despite some technical bullish signals.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, offsetting the bullish momentum seen in technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, bullish momentum in technical indicators and recent price increases provide a modestly positive outlook.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and the potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation as a safe haven is prudent."
2024-08-10 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight upward price movements and some bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin is holding steady after a recent rally, despite subdued market momentum. Ethereum is experiencing pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs, which has negatively impacted its price. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation, but maintains bullish momentum. Dogecoin is experiencing increased transaction activity, but lacks significant news to drive its price. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amid ongoing legal disputes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin is showing resilience with a buy signal from the short MA crossing above the long MA, but overall market momentum remains subdued. The asset is a stable hold with potential for incremental gains.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite bullish momentum signals, recent heavy sell-offs by market-makers create downside risk. The asset is under pressure, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana exhibits bullish momentum and slight price increases, although the large whale transfer to Binance suggests caution. The asset remains attractive due to its technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin shows bullish momentum and increased transaction activity, but lacks significant news to drive strong price movements. A slight positive allocation is justified.

USDT: 0.0 — With a high market cap and ongoing legal issues, USDT remains a neutral hold. It provides stability in the portfolio amidst mixed market conditions."
2024-08-10 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and stable interest rates, with the S&P 500 indicating a generally positive sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is showing resilience despite subdued momentum, while Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana has seen a large whale transfer, potentially indicating a bearish outlook. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, and Tether's market cap has reached a new high amidst legal disputes, suggesting a strong demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and stable price action suggest a cautious buy, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of strong bullish signals warrant a cautious approach, suggesting reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to Binance indicates potential selling pressure, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current position seems prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the legal disputes and high market cap, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides stability amidst uncertain market conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing resilience with a stable price after a recent rally, although its momentum remains subdued. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has impacted its price negatively. Solana experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, indicating potential distribution or liquidation, which could signal bearish sentiment. Dogecoin has no significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, reflecting its continued demand as a stablecoin, although it faces legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and stable price suggest a cautious buy, especially given its significant market cap and on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent heavy sell-offs by market makers and lack of positive news create a bearish outlook, justifying a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to Binance indicates potential selling pressure, warranting a slight reduction in allocation to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in data, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-10 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with the VIX at 20.48, indicating some caution in broader markets. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing mixed signals with BTC showing resilience despite a recent decline, while ETH faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. SOL has seen a large whale transfer, which could indicate potential selling pressure. DOGE remains stable with no significant news, and USDT continues to grow its market cap, highlighting its role as a safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and technical buy signals suggest a moderate preference for increasing exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent sell-offs by major market makers and a lack of strong bullish signals warrant a cautious stance, though existing holdings are minimal.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, prompting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and USDT's growing market cap, a slight increase in stablecoin holdings is prudent for risk management."
2024-08-10 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum and Ethereum facing sell-off pressure from major market-makers. Solana is experiencing potential liquidation signals from a whale transfer, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst legal disputes. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant shifts in major indicators such as interest rates or the S&P 500, suggesting a cautious but steady market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a lack of strong momentum signals, Bitcoin's resilience and stable on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal, maintaining its position as a core portfolio asset.

ETH: -0.1 — The heavy sell-off pressure from market-makers and recent price decline warrant a cautious stance, though the overall technicals remain supportive.

SOL: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential selling pressure, offsetting the otherwise bullish momentum and technical signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite no significant news, Dogecoin's consistent buy signals and activity surges suggest a slight increase in allocation could be beneficial.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential volatility in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safety net and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-10 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with mixed signals. Bitcoin is showing resilience despite subdued market momentum and a recent price decline. Ethereum is under pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has driven its price down. Solana has experienced a large whale transfer to Binance, potentially indicating a distribution or liquidation event. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a stable outlook. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, but it faces legal challenges from Celsius, which could introduce some uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and positive trend signals suggest a moderate buy preference, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressures and recent price declines warrant caution, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure until clearer bullish signals emerge.

SOL: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty, balancing out the positive technical signals, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in data, DOGE remains stable, justifying a hold position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and legal uncertainties, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a defensive measure is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum and Ethereum facing selling pressure from major market makers. Solana's recent whale transfer to Binance suggests potential distribution, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins, possibly due to increased market uncertainty. The macroeconomic environment, with moderate volatility and stable commodity prices, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and buy signals from technical indicators suggest a moderate preference for holding or slightly increasing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure from market makers and a lack of bullish momentum indicate a cautious stance, with a preference to reduce exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — The whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential selling pressure, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and Tether's increasing market cap, a slight preference for maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-08-10 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum, while Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana has seen potential distribution activity with a large whale transfer to an exchange, indicating possible liquidation. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. Tether continues to grow its market cap, although it faces legal challenges. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. dollar index and rising gold prices, suggesting a cautious risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin's price stability and buy signals from trend indicators suggest a moderate positive outlook, although momentum remains subdued.

ETH: -0.3 — Heavy sell-off pressures and lack of bullish momentum indicate a cautious stance, especially given the minimal current holding.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to an exchange suggests potential downward pressure, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, the bullish momentum signal and increased on-chain activity support a modest positive outlook.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against market fluctuations."
2024-08-10 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady after a recent rally, with technical indicators suggesting a period of consolidation. Ethereum (ETH) faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down significantly. Solana (SOL) is experiencing potential distribution pressure due to a large whale transfer to an exchange, indicating possible liquidation. Dogecoin (DOGE) shows signs of bullish momentum with price breaking above the upper Bollinger Band, although there is no significant news to further support this movement. Tether (USDT) has reached a new market cap high, but faces legal challenges, which could impact its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued market momentum, BTC's resilience and consolidation suggest a stable outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.5 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of positive news create a bearish outlook, justifying a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to Binance signals potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious approach and slight reduction in holdings.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum indicators and a breakout above the Bollinger Band suggest potential upside, supporting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market conditions and legal uncertainties, maintaining a slight preference for holding USDT as a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-10 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum, while Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana's recent whale transfer to an exchange suggests potential liquidation, which could impact its price negatively. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows some bullish technical signals. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap has reached a new high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst market uncertainties. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a high gold price, suggests a cautious risk environment, potentially favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal, especially as it holds steady in its range.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure from market makers and lack of positive news weigh on ETH, suggesting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to Binance indicates potential selling pressure, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of news, bullish momentum signals and recent price increases suggest a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market conditions and high volatility, maintaining a strong USDT position provides a hedge against potential downturns in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience and maintaining its price level despite subdued momentum. Ethereum faces significant sell pressure from market makers, which has dragged its price down, indicating potential bearish sentiment. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to Binance, suggesting possible liquidation or distribution, which could lead to increased volatility. Dogecoin has shown bullish momentum technically, but lacks significant news to drive further sentiment. Tether continues to grow in market cap, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and recent buy signals suggest a moderate bullish outlook. The lack of significant negative news supports maintaining a positive stance.

ETH: -0.5 — Heavy sell-off pressure from market makers and lack of bullish technical signals indicate a bearish sentiment. Given the minimal current holding, reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to an exchange suggests potential selling pressure, warranting caution. The absence of strong bullish signals supports a slightly negative stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish technical indicators and price momentum suggest a positive outlook, though the lack of significant news tempers the enthusiasm.

USDT: +0.2 — The increase in market cap and ongoing legal issues suggest a continued demand for stability, justifying a slight preference for holding USDT amidst mixed market conditions."
2024-08-10 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite a recent decline and maintaining a stable price range. Ethereum is experiencing pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, potentially indicating future selling pressure. Dogecoin has shown bullish momentum in technical indicators, but lacks significant news to drive further movement. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, but it faces legal challenges, which may impact its stability perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows stable price action and bullish momentum, with on-chain activity indicating continued interest. Despite subdued market momentum, its resilience suggests a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces downward pressure from large sell-offs, and technical indicators do not support a bullish stance. Holding off on allocation until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, and technical indicators do not show strong buy signals. Reducing exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite low on-chain activity, Dogecoin's technical indicators show bullish momentum, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a stable market cap and ongoing legal issues, Tether remains a safe haven. However, the overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, suggesting a rotation out of stablecoins."
2024-08-10 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates. The cryptocurrency market shows varied signals across different assets. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing stable trading with subdued momentum, while Ethereum (ETH) faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana (SOL) is seeing potential liquidation activity, which could indicate bearish sentiment. Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains bullish technical indicators but lacks significant news to drive strong sentiment changes. Tether (USDT) has reached a new market cap high, indicating strong demand for stability amidst market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's stable trading and resilience suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent sell-offs by major market makers create uncertainty, balancing out any potential buy signals from technical indicators.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to an exchange suggests potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious approach given current holdings.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish technical indicators support a slight increase in allocation, although the absence of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: +0.1 — With market uncertainties and a high market cap, maintaining a stablecoin buffer is prudent, but not overly aggressive given the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets."
2024-08-10 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with BTC showing resilience and maintaining a stable price range despite subdued market momentum. Ethereum is experiencing pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has impacted its price negatively. Solana faces potential distribution or liquidation concerns due to a large whale transfer to Binance, which could increase volatility. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news affecting its sentiment. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst ongoing legal disputes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — BTC shows stable price action with bullish technical indicators, suggesting a moderate buy signal. The resilience in price amidst subdued momentum supports maintaining a positive stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite technical indicators showing no bullish signals, the recent sell-off pressure is already reflected in the price. A neutral stance is appropriate until further clarity emerges.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious approach. Given current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: +0.3 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and stable price action support a modest increase in exposure, despite the absence of significant news.

USDT: -0.4 — The increased market cap and ongoing legal issues suggest a mixed outlook, but the overall market sentiment leans towards risk-on, justifying a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite a recent decline and maintaining a stable trading range. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has kept its price subdued. Solana experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential distribution or liquidation, which could lead to increased volatility. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news impacting its market dynamics. Tether continues to grow its market cap, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst market uncertainties, although it faces legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's technical indicators are positive, with a buy signal from moving averages and bullish momentum. Despite low on-chain activity, its price stability and resilience make it relatively attractive.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is under pressure from significant sell-offs, and technical indicators do not support a buy. Maintaining a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, which could lead to price declines. Reducing exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin shows consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, with no adverse news affecting its outlook. A modest increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: +0.6 — With market uncertainties and ETH's sell-off, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a stable hedge and liquidity for potential opportunities."
2024-08-11 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across several major cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC and DOGE. Bitcoin shows consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, supported by stable on-chain activity. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, faces resistance and lacks clear bullish signals, indicating potential caution. Solana maintains bullish momentum with consistent on-chain activity, while Dogecoin exhibits strong upward momentum, possibly driven by speculative interest. Tether's market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing utility and dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with stable on-chain activity, suggest a strong position for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum faces resistance and lacks clear bullish signals, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong upward momentum and speculative interest provide a positive outlook, justifying increased exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-11 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with signs of bullish momentum across several cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin shows consistent upward momentum with a surge in on-chain activity, suggesting increased investor interest. Ethereum, although having rallied recently, faces resistance and lacks strong buy signals, indicating potential caution. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit strong technical indicators, with Dogecoin experiencing significant price increases driven by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing role as a stablecoin, although the broader market's risk appetite may reduce its relative attractiveness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest a favorable environment for further gains, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum faces resistance and lacks clear buy signals, suggesting a hold position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum indicate potential for further appreciation, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase and bullish technical indicators, driven by speculative interest, suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets is prudent, despite Tether's strong market position."
2024-08-11 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with several cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a strong buy signal with consistent bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, despite the absence of significant news. Ethereum (ETH) has recently rallied but faces resistance, suggesting a potential pause or pullback. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) both exhibit strong technical buy signals, with DOGE experiencing significant price increases and speculative interest. Tether (USDT) remains a stable option, bolstered by its market cap milestone and new developments on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, though its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive positioning in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Consistent bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential, making it a strong candidate for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent gains, ETH faces resistance and mixed sentiment, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal, suggesting potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong price momentum and speculative interest drive a positive outlook, though caution is advised due to its volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with BTC, SOL, and DOGE exhibiting strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's on-chain activity indicates a surge in transactions, suggesting increased network usage, while Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing bullish momentum with potential breakouts. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, faces resistance and mixed sentiment. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance as a stablecoin, though its role as a safe haven may be less prioritized in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Consistent buy signals and increased on-chain activity suggest strong network engagement and bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent resistance, the overall market sentiment is positive, and ETH's technicals are improving, warranting a cautious buy.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and consistent volume suggest continued bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and potential breakout signals indicate a favorable environment for short-term gains, though caution is advised due to hype-driven volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish market sentiment, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for a large USDT position."
2024-08-11 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with several cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and momentum. Bitcoin and Solana are experiencing strong buy signals based on trend and momentum indicators, while Ethereum has faced resistance after a significant rally. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative interest, driven by hype cycles, but lacks substantial fundamental support. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing utility and dominance as a stablecoin. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical indicators warrant a moderate positive outlook, though caution is advised due to potential resistance levels.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's consistent buy signals and positive momentum, along with stable on-chain activity, make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has speculative interest, the lack of substantial news or technical support suggests a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-11 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and positive trend indicators. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing strong technical buy signals, though Ethereum faces resistance after a recent rally. Solana and Dogecoin also exhibit bullish momentum, with Dogecoin driven by speculative interest. Tether's stability is reinforced by its significant market cap milestone and the launch of USDT on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amid market volatility. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a diversified approach across crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a favorable environment for moderate capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical signals warrant a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — While driven by speculative interest, Dogecoin's technical signals are positive, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With stablecoin demand remaining strong, maintain current exposure to USDT as a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-11 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, with the S&P 500 maintaining strength. In the crypto market, most assets exhibit bullish technical indicators, with short-term moving averages above long-term ones and positive momentum signals. Ethereum has experienced a significant rally but faces resistance, while Dogecoin remains speculative with discussions around its potential price surge. Tether continues to solidify its position as the leading stablecoin, achieving a significant market cap milestone and expanding its utility with the launch on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a general preference for risk assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows consistent bullish technical signals with a stable price regime. While on-chain activity is low, the overall market sentiment supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance after a significant rally, Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical indicators suggest a cautious buy, though the potential for a pullback warrants a tempered score.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana maintains strong technical indicators and normal on-chain activity, supporting a positive outlook. The absence of significant news keeps the focus on its technical strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions about its price potential, Dogecoin's fundamentals remain unchanged, warranting a neutral stance given its hype-driven nature.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing a preference for risk assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected, though its strong market position provides stability."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with most assets displaying upward price movements and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing slight price increases, supported by bullish momentum, although on-chain activity remains relatively low. Ethereum (ETH) has seen a significant rally, although it faces resistance at higher levels, suggesting potential caution. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) both show strong technical indicators, with SOL breaking above its Bollinger Bands, indicating a potential breakout. Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) continues to solidify its position as the leading stablecoin, with its market cap reaching new highs and the introduction of USDT on the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite low on-chain activity, BTC's upward price momentum and strong technical indicators suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While ETH has rallied significantly, resistance at higher levels warrants a cautious approach. However, bullish momentum supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL's breakout above Bollinger Bands and consistent bullish momentum indicate strong potential for further gains, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — DOGE shows bullish momentum and positive sentiment driven by speculative interest, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the market, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-08-11 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a general upward trend in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL, supported by positive technical indicators such as bullish momentum and trend signals. Ethereum has experienced a significant rally, though it faces resistance at higher levels. Dogecoin continues to be driven by speculative interest, with discussions about its potential to reach $1. Meanwhile, Tether's USDT has reached a new market cap milestone, reinforcing its dominance in the stablecoin market. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a balanced risk environment, encouraging some capital allocation into riskier assets while maintaining a safety net in stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Strong buy signals and increased on-chain activity suggest positive momentum, though the absence of significant news keeps the score moderate.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite hitting resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum indicators warrant a higher allocation, supported by increased on-chain activity.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a positive outlook, though the lack of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative interest, the lack of substantial news or technical shifts keeps the allocation neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — As market conditions favor riskier assets, some capital can be rotated out of USDT, though its stability and recent developments on the Lightning Network provide a safety buffer."
2024-08-11 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively neutral risk sentiment. In the crypto market, most assets are exhibiting bullish technical indicators with short-term moving averages above long-term ones, indicating potential upward momentum. Ethereum has shown a significant rally recently but is facing resistance, while Dogecoin continues to be driven by speculative interest. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing utility and stability, making it a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows consistent bullish technical signals and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a positive outlook despite the lack of significant news.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's strong rally and bullish technicals indicate potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to the resistance level.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana maintains strong technical indicators and normal on-chain activity, supporting a moderately positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative interest in Dogecoin, the lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-11 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators, such as buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum from MACD. However, there are signs of resistance and potential bearish momentum, particularly in Ethereum, which recently rallied but faced resistance. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which might limit upside potential. Tether's significant market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance as a stablecoin, suggesting a strong demand for stability in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite low on-chain activity, BTC maintains a buy signal from moving averages and bullish momentum, indicating potential for continued growth. However, the lack of significant news and a strong dollar cap the upside.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent rally and bullish technical indicators are tempered by resistance and bearish sentiment from news. This warrants a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, combined with stable on-chain activity, suggest a positive outlook, though no significant news limits the strength of the signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions about its potential, DOGE's price remains driven by hype cycles without substantial data or news to support a directional move.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT, despite its strong market position and recent developments."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context indicates a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as evidenced by the VIX at 20.6. The crypto market shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin experiencing a slight decline and potential breakdown, while Ethereum has recently rallied but faces resistance. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit bullish technical indicators, though DOGE's price is highly speculative, driven by hype. Tether (USDT) remains strong, reaching a significant market cap milestone and expanding its utility with the launch of USDT-L on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a preference for stablecoins in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, BTC's technical indicators remain bullish, and on-chain activity is robust. However, caution is warranted due to potential breakdown signals.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum are promising, but resistance levels and mixed news sentiment suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity make Solana relatively attractive, despite minor price declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, DOGE's speculative nature and lack of significant news warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With a strong market cap and new developments, USDT remains a safe haven. However, slight capital rotation into riskier assets is observed, justifying a minor reduction in exposure."
2024-08-11 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with slight declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Despite the short-term bearish signals, the long-term trend indicators remain positive, suggesting potential for recovery. Ethereum's recent rally faced resistance, indicating potential consolidation, while Dogecoin's price continues to be influenced by speculative interest. Tether's significant market cap milestone and its expansion onto the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance in the stablecoin space. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a balanced risk environment, favoring a diversified approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and low on-chain activity, the long-term trend remains positive, suggesting potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to the recent breakdown below the Bollinger Bands.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum indicators support a positive outlook, although resistance levels could limit immediate upside. The overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

SOL: +0.2 — Although facing a recent price decline and breakdown signals, Solana's long-term trend is still positive. The absence of significant news keeps the outlook moderately favorable.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative interest and discussions about future price potential, current technical indicators do not provide a strong directional signal. Maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current market environment showing signs of potential recovery, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly in favor of riskier assets could be beneficial, while still maintaining a substantial USDT position for stability."
2024-08-11 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight downward trend with no significant news to drive price action, while Ethereum has seen a recent rally but is now facing resistance and potential bearish momentum. Solana's technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook with prices below key moving averages. Dogecoin remains driven by speculative hype, with discussions around its potential to reach $1, although its technical indicators are not currently supportive. Tether continues to strengthen its position as the leading stablecoin, with a significant market cap milestone and new developments on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Overall, the macroeconomic context indicates a stable environment with moderate volatility, which could support a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a recent downtrend and lack of significant news, Bitcoin's overall market position remains stable. No clear signals to adjust current holdings.

ETH: +0.3 — Recent rally and strong technical indicators suggest potential for further gains, though resistance is noted. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: -0.3 — Bearish technical signals and lack of supportive news suggest reducing exposure to mitigate potential downside risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative sentiment remains high, but technical indicators do not support a clear directional move. Maintain current position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and USDT's strong market position, a slight increase in stablecoin holdings can provide a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-11 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the consistent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past hours. Despite some technical buy signals, the lack of bullish momentum and breakdowns below Bollinger Bands suggest potential further downside. Ethereum's recent rally faced resistance, and DOGE remains driven by speculative hype. Meanwhile, USDT's market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance and utility as a stable asset in uncertain conditions. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a relatively high VIX and stable dollar, suggests a risk-off environment, favoring stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite technical buy signals, BTC's consistent price decline and lack of bullish momentum suggest caution. The absence of significant news further supports a conservative stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent resistance after a rally and mixed momentum signals indicate a neutral position. The market seems undecided on ETH's next move, warranting a hold.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price decreases and lack of bullish momentum, combined with no supportive news, suggest reducing exposure slightly.

DOGE: -0.1 — While speculative interest remains, the lack of bullish momentum and significant price decline suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.6 — In a risk-off environment with declining crypto prices, increasing USDT holdings is prudent to preserve capital and wait for clearer market signals."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with the VIX at 20.6, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index at 103.14. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin and Solana showing potential breakdowns as they trade below their Bollinger Bands, indicating possible bearish sentiment. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, faces resistance and bearish momentum, while Dogecoin's price remains speculative, driven by hype. Tether's market cap milestone and the launch of USDT on the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance in the stablecoin market. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with a preference for stability and consolidation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakdown with low on-chain activity and no significant news to support a bullish case. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish technical indicators.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum faces resistance and bearish momentum. The lack of strong bullish signals and mixed sentiment suggests holding the current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana is experiencing significant price decreases and potential breakdowns, with no supportive news or technical indicators. Reducing exposure is advisable to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype, with no substantial changes in data or sentiment. Maintaining the current position is appropriate given the lack of clear direction.

USDT: +0.7 — In a cautious market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is favorable due to its stability and recent positive developments, such as the market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network."
2024-08-11 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a VIX of 20.6, suggesting some market uncertainty. The U.S. Dollar Index is relatively stable, and the S&P 500 is at a high level, indicating a mixed sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakdown, with its price below the lower Bollinger Band and no significant news to drive momentum. Ethereum has shown a recent rally but faces resistance and bearish momentum. Solana is also in a potential breakdown phase, while Dogecoin's price remains speculative, driven by hype cycles. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance and utility as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.4 — Bitcoin is experiencing low on-chain activity and is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Without significant news to drive a reversal, a cautious reduction in exposure is warranted.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum faces resistance and bearish momentum. The mixed technicals and lack of strong bullish news suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana is in a potential breakdown phase with no buy signals or significant news. Reducing exposure is prudent given the lack of positive momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains speculative with no strong technical or news-driven catalysts. Maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.7 — With market uncertainty and potential downside in other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-11 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a mixed environment with relatively high volatility as indicated by the VIX at 20.6. The crypto market shows signs of consolidation with Bitcoin and Solana experiencing potential breakdowns, while Ethereum has recently rallied but is facing resistance. Dogecoin's price remains driven by speculative hype, and Tether continues to solidify its position as the leading stablecoin. Overall, the sentiment is cautious, with no strong bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, suggesting a balanced approach to risk management is prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Bitcoin is experiencing low on-chain activity and lacks bullish technical signals. Without significant news, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and positive trend signal suggest a moderate opportunity for gains, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — Solana shows signs of a potential breakdown with no bullish signals. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is advisable to manage downside risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype with no clear technical or fundamental support. Holding the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — With market uncertainty and Tether's strong market position, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-11 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment reflects moderate volatility with the VIX at 20.6, suggesting some market caution. The S&P 500 is relatively high, indicating a general risk-on sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto. Bitcoin and Solana are showing technical weakness with prices below key moving averages and Bollinger Bands suggesting potential breakdowns. Ethereum has shown a recent rally but is facing resistance, while Dogecoin's price remains speculative with no clear technical signals. Tether's strong market cap and recent developments on the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its stability and growing utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent surge in on-chain activity, technical indicators suggest potential weakness. Maintaining a cautious stance due to lack of bullish signals.

ETH: +0.1 — Recent rally and resistance indicate potential for upside, but bearish momentum limits confidence. Holding with slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical indicators are weak, with no significant news to drive price action. Maintaining a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Price driven by speculative hype, with no strong technical or news-based catalysts. Holding position without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of technical weaknesses in other assets and strong market cap growth, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent significant price decreases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Technical indicators for these assets show no strong buy signals, and many are experiencing breakdowns below their Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential further downside. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility (VIX), supports a risk-off sentiment, which typically favors stable assets like USDT. News highlights include Ethereum's recent rally facing resistance and Tether's expansion with a new milestone in market cap and technological advancements, which could bolster confidence in USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price breakdown and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain some exposure due to its market dominance but reduce slightly to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, ETH faces resistance and bearish momentum. Hold current position as technicals and news provide mixed signals.

SOL: -0.2 — Price breakdown below Bollinger Bands with no positive technical signals. Reduce exposure slightly while monitoring for potential recovery.

DOGE: -0.1 — Driven by speculative sentiment with no strong technical or fundamental support. Reduce exposure slightly amid broader market weakness.

USDT: +0.6 — Favorable macroeconomic conditions and strong market cap growth make USDT an attractive safe haven. Increase exposure to manage portfolio risk."
2024-08-11 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with significant price declines in BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Technical indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with most assets experiencing breakdowns below their lower Bollinger Bands. On-chain activity for BTC shows a surge, indicating potential panic selling or increased trading activity. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable and has shown bullish technical signals, supported by its recent market cap milestone and expansion into the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This suggests a flight to safety as investors seek stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Significant price decline and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite a recent rally, ETH faces resistance and bearish momentum, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.4 — Price breakdown and lack of bullish signals indicate a need to reduce exposure in line with broader market sentiment.

DOGE: -0.2 — While DOGE has speculative potential, current bearish trends and low activity suggest reducing holdings.

USDT: +0.8 — Strong technical signals and recent market cap growth indicate a preference for stability, making USDT an attractive safe haven in current conditions."
2024-08-11 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Technical indicators show no buy signals, and momentum remains weak, suggesting a lack of bullish sentiment. On-chain activity for BTC shows a surge, but this hasn't translated into price support. Ethereum's recent rally faced resistance, indicating potential bearish momentum. Meanwhile, USDT has shown strength, with a bullish trend and momentum signals, supported by positive news regarding its market cap milestone and the launch of USDT-L on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. In this environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT seems prudent, given the volatility and lack of clear upward trends in other assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite increased on-chain activity, BTC's price remains under pressure with no bullish technical signals. Maintaining a cautious stance is advisable.

ETH: -0.2 — Recent resistance after a rally and bearish momentum suggest caution. Holding but not increasing exposure is recommended.

SOL: -0.1 — Continuous price declines and lack of positive technical signals warrant a cautious approach. Slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative news, DOGE's technical indicators are weak, and price remains volatile. Holding without increasing exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — Strong technical signals and positive news support maintaining a higher allocation in USDT, providing stability amidst broader market volatility."
2024-08-11 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price decreases observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD signals suggest a lack of bullish momentum, and several assets are trading below their Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Despite this, USDT has shown strength, maintaining its position as a stable asset with a recent milestone in market capitalization and new developments like the launch of USDT-L on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index (VIX) and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Continued bearish technical indicators and price breakdowns suggest reducing exposure, especially with no significant positive news to counteract the trend.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent rally faced resistance and bearish momentum persists, warranting a slight reduction in exposure given the current market environment.

SOL: -0.2 — Consistent price declines and lack of positive news or technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative news, the lack of technical support or significant positive developments results in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Technical indicators suggest no strong buy signals, with most assets trading below their short-term moving averages and MACD signals remaining bearish. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggests a risk-off sentiment, which typically favors stable assets like USDT. The news highlights a significant milestone for USDT, reinforcing its dominance in the stablecoin market, while Ethereum's recent rally faced resistance, indicating potential short-term bearishness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent price decline and increased on-chain activity, technical indicators remain bearish, suggesting caution in increasing BTC exposure.

ETH: -0.2 — Recent rally faced resistance, and technical indicators are bearish. The lack of bullish momentum suggests maintaining a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Price declines and bearish technical signals suggest a cautious approach, despite no significant news impacting sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative interest remains, the lack of significant bullish signals or news suggests holding current exposure without increasing it.

USDT: +0.6 — In a risk-off environment with bearish signals across other assets, USDT's stability and recent market cap milestone make it an attractive safe haven."
2024-08-12 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment suggests a cautious approach, with relatively high volatility (VIX at 20.71) and a stable U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 103.14). The crypto market is experiencing a downturn, with significant price declines across major assets like BTC and ETH, driven by ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders. Solana shows some technical resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, which might indicate a potential recovery. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with Tether actively managing legal challenges and expanding its educational initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. Despite Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings, the overall sentiment remains bearish.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off by a whale and technical weakness suggest further downside risk. The price is nearing a critical support level, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Technical strength shown by the bounce off the 200-day EMA indicates potential for recovery, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. The slight price increase is not enough to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-08-12 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with notable declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, which have both experienced significant price drops over the past 24 hours. BTC's decline is compounded by ETF outflows, while ETH faces potential sell-off pressure from large holders. Despite these challenges, SOL shows technical resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, DOGE remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its price. USDT continues to maintain its stability, with Tether actively defending its position against legal challenges and promoting blockchain education initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price decline and ETF outflows indicate bearish sentiment, suggesting a cautious approach to BTC holdings.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential for a significant sell-off by large holders and recent price drop below key support levels warrant a reduction in ETH exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite broader market declines, SOL's technical rebound off the 200-day EMA suggests potential for upward movement, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-08-12 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced significant outflows from ETFs, indicating reduced institutional interest, while Ethereum is facing potential sell pressure from large holders. Solana, however, shows some technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, which may suggest renewed bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, does not provide strong directional cues, leaving the market driven by asset-specific developments and technical signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings, the ETF outflows and recent price decline suggest caution. The lack of bullish technical signals further supports a conservative stance.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off from a large holder and recent price drop below key support levels indicate bearish sentiment. On-chain indicators also point to fading bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — The bounce off the 200-day EMA suggests technical strength, and the slight price increase in recent hours supports a modestly positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, there is no clear directional bias for Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of bearish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer, despite the ongoing legal issues with Celsius."
2024-08-12 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin is experiencing outflows from ETFs, indicating reduced institutional interest, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from large holders. Solana shows some technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively high VIX and stable US dollar, suggests market participants are wary of risk, favoring stability over aggressive risk-taking. In this context, USDT remains a safe haven, especially as Tether reassures stability amid legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent ETF outflows and price declines suggest caution. Despite Marathon Digital's plans to buy more BTC, the immediate sentiment remains bearish.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off pressure from a large whale and recent price drops indicate a bearish outlook, with support around $2,500 being tested.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical rebound from the 200-day EMA hints at renewed bullish sentiment, making it relatively more attractive in a cautious market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance, with no clear directional bias.

USDT: +0.4 — In a risk-averse environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, especially given Tether's reassurances of stability."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, accompanied by significant outflows from BTC ETFs and potential sell-offs by large ETH holders. Despite the bearish pressure, Solana shows signs of technical strength, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, which may indicate renewed interest. Meanwhile, DOGE remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. USDT continues to maintain its stability, with Tether actively addressing legal challenges and expanding educational initiatives, suggesting a focus on maintaining trust and stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. Although Marathon Digital's plans to buy more BTC could be supportive, the immediate sentiment remains bearish.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off by a whale and recent price drop below key support levels indicate bearish sentiment. On-chain indicators also suggest fading bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength is evident with a rebound from the 200-day EMA, signaling potential bullish sentiment. This makes SOL relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, DOGE remains neutral, lacking clear directional signals.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment in other assets, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven, while Tether's proactive measures support its stability."
2024-08-12 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with notable declines in both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has experienced significant outflows from ETFs, indicating reduced institutional interest, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from a large whale movement. Solana shows some technical strength, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, which may signal a potential bullish reversal. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news, while Tether is embroiled in legal disputes but maintains its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent ETF outflows and price declines suggest a cautious approach. Maintain some exposure but reduce slightly due to bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.5 — Potential sell-off from whale activity and recent price drop below key support levels indicate further downside risk. Reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical rebound from the 200-day EMA suggests potential for upward movement. Increase exposure modestly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes keeps sentiment neutral. Hold current position.

USDT: +0.5 — Bearish market conditions and reduced risk appetite favor holding more stablecoins. Increase exposure to USDT."
2024-08-12 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant price declines over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin's dip is exacerbated by notable outflows from U.S. BTC ETFs, while Ethereum faces potential sell-off pressure from a whale moving significant amounts of ETH to an exchange. Solana shows some technical resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, which might indicate some bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news, while Tether is involved in legal disputes but maintains its stability. The macroeconomic environment, with a high VIX and stable U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite Marathon Digital's plans to buy more BTC, the ETF outflows and recent price decline suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off by a whale and the recent price drop below key support levels indicate bearish sentiment. Reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: +0.3 — The bounce off the 200-day EMA suggests technical strength, warranting a modest increase in allocation to capitalize on potential bullish momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or market movements, maintaining the current position is advisable.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the overall bearish sentiment and market volatility, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-12 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines in price over the past 24 hours, influenced by ETF outflows and potential large sell-offs, respectively. Solana shows signs of technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin has seen a significant price increase in the last hour, but lacks substantial news to support sustained momentum. Tether remains stable amidst legal challenges, maintaining its role as a safe haven during uncertain market conditions. Overall, the macroeconomic context suggests caution, with relatively high volatility and a stable U.S. dollar index, which may prompt a conservative approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent price increase, BTC is facing downward pressure from ETF outflows and lacks bullish technical signals. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential for a large sell-off by a whale and recent price declines suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure to mitigate potential losses.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical indicators show bullish momentum, and the recent rebound from the 200-day EMA suggests potential for further gains. Increasing exposure to capitalize on positive sentiment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum signal, but lack of significant news limits confidence. Slightly increasing exposure to capture potential upside.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies and ongoing legal challenges, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with notable declines in both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, driven by significant outflows from BTC ETFs and potential sell-offs by large ETH holders. Despite these bearish signals, Solana shows technical strength by bouncing off its 200-day EMA, suggesting some bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its price. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious approach, with a potential preference for stablecoins like USDT in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price decline and ETF outflows indicate bearish sentiment, but the miner's plans to buy more BTC could provide some support. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

ETH: -0.4 — The transfer of ETH by a whale to an exchange suggests potential selling pressure, coupled with a recent price dip. Reducing exposure is advisable given the bearish outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the broader market downturn, Solana's technical rebound from the 200-day EMA indicates potential bullish momentum, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining the current position is reasonable.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, increasing USDT holdings provides a safer hedge against market volatility."
2024-08-12 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, influenced by ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders, respectively. Despite these declines, Solana shows signs of technical strength, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, which may indicate renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is dealing with legal challenges but maintains its stability. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable gold prices, suggests caution, potentially favoring a more conservative allocation strategy.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. Despite Marathon Digital's plans to acquire more BTC, the overall sentiment remains bearish.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off by a large holder and recent price drop below $2,600 indicate bearish sentiment. Support around $2,500 may be tested.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength after bouncing off the 200-day EMA and positive momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook compared to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators result in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides stability amidst market uncertainty."
2024-08-12 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced recent price declines, influenced by ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders, respectively. However, Bitcoin's potential for increased holdings by Marathon Digital suggests some underlying bullish sentiment. Solana shows technical strength by bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish interest. Dogecoin lacks significant news, but it has shown bullish momentum in recent hours. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not impacting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, Marathon Digital's plan to increase BTC holdings provides a potential bullish catalyst. However, ETF outflows temper enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.2 — The potential sell-off by a large holder and recent price declines suggest caution. However, the price is nearing a key support level, which may limit downside risk.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical rebound off the 200-day EMA and bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable short-term outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum indicators and recent price increases warrant a modestly positive outlook, despite the lack of significant news.

USDT: -0.4 — With some assets showing bullish signals, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2024-08-12 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent dips and ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's intent to increase BTC holdings and the current bullish momentum suggest potential for recovery.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent sell-offs and whale movements indicating potential downward pressure, though recent price recovery suggests holding for now.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical rebound from the 200-day EMA and consistent bullish momentum make Solana an attractive option for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Consistent upward momentum and technical indicators suggest a moderate buy, though lacking significant news catalysts.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased bullish sentiment in other assets, there is a moderate shift away from stablecoins as risk appetite grows."
2024-08-12 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish technical signals and some bearish news. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight dip due to ETF outflows, but there is potential for future accumulation by Marathon Digital. Ethereum shows signs of bearish pressure with significant whale movements suggesting potential sell-offs, though technical indicators remain bullish. Solana is showing technical strength after bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains bullish technical indicators. Tether remains stable despite legal challenges, with ongoing efforts to bolster its reputation through educational initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips and ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings suggest potential future support. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish technicals but bearish news from whale movements. Hold position as the market digests these developments.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical rebound off the 200-day EMA and bullish momentum suggest increased capital allocation is warranted.

DOGE: +0.2 — While lacking significant news, DOGE maintains bullish momentum and technical indicators, justifying a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — As bullish sentiment grows across other assets, reduce stablecoin holdings to rotate capital into more promising opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, influenced by ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders. Despite these setbacks, technical indicators for assets like SOL suggest underlying strength, as it rebounded off its 200-day EMA. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, which could support a cautious approach to risk assets. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with ongoing legal and educational developments that do not seem to impact its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. Despite bullish momentum signals, the macro environment and news indicate potential further downside.

ETH: -0.1 — The potential sell-off by a whale and recent price drop below $2,600 warrant a cautious stance, though technical indicators remain somewhat supportive.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength shown by the rebound off the 200-day EMA and continued bullish momentum suggest a favorable outlook relative to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, DOGE remains neutral in the current environment.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market uncertainty and recent declines in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent to manage risk."
2024-08-12 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant price increases observed in the last hour across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, suggesting a potential bullish trend. However, recent news highlights some bearish pressures, such as BTC ETF outflows and potential ETH sell-offs by whales, which could temper enthusiasm. Solana shows technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, while DOGE lacks significant news but follows the general market uptrend. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, supports a balanced risk approach, with potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows, BTC shows strong upward momentum and bullish technical indicators. Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings also provide a positive long-term outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — While there is potential sell pressure from a whale, ETH's recent price surge and bullish technical indicators suggest a cautious optimism. However, the risk of further sell-offs tempers the score.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's technical rebound and strong market activity signal a robust bullish sentiment, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — DOGE follows the broader market's upward trend with strong momentum, despite the absence of significant news. Its low price and high volume make it a speculative buy.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capture potential gains in more volatile cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-12 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility and significant price movements across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a notable dip, influenced by ETF outflows, but there's potential for increased holdings by Marathon Digital. Ethereum faces bearish pressure with a significant whale movement suggesting potential sell-offs, and its price is approaching critical support levels. Solana shows technical strength, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is maintaining its stability despite legal challenges and is actively engaging in educational initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips and ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings could provide support. The overall bullish momentum remains intact.

ETH: -0.3 — The potential for a sell-off by a significant whale and bearish momentum indicators suggest caution. The price is nearing a critical support level, warranting a more conservative approach.

SOL: +0.5 — The rebound off the 200-day EMA and consistent bullish momentum indicate potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.2 — While maintaining some exposure for stability, the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets suggests a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-12 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market is experiencing a mixed sentiment with recent declines in major assets like BTC and ETH, driven by significant outflows and potential sell-offs. Bitcoin has seen a dip amid ETF outflows, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure with large transfers suggesting possible sell-offs. Solana shows technical resilience, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news impacting its market. Tether maintains its stability despite legal challenges, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. Despite Marathon's expansion plans, the immediate sentiment is bearish.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off signals from whale movements and recent price dips indicate bearish sentiment. Support at $2,500 is a key level to watch.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength shown by the bounce off the 200-day EMA suggests bullish potential. Positive sentiment compared to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps Dogecoin neutral. No strong signals to adjust current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment in major assets, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent for risk management."
2024-08-12 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant declines observed in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, exacerbated by ETF outflows, while Ethereum's decline is compounded by potential whale sell-offs. Despite these negative trends, Solana shows signs of technical strength, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, which may indicate renewed bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable amidst legal challenges. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach, with potential for capital rotation into more stable assets like USDT during these uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite technical buy signals, the recent price decline and ETF outflows suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for stabilization.

ETH: -0.5 — The potential for a sell-off due to whale activity and significant price drop warrants a cautious stance. Reducing exposure to manage risk.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical strength from the rebound off the 200-day EMA provides a positive outlook, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of bearish market conditions and potential capital outflows from riskier assets, increasing allocation to USDT for stability and liquidity."
2024-08-12 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum despite recent price declines. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant outflows and sell pressure, respectively, but technical indicators remain positive. Solana has shown technical strength by bouncing off a key moving average, while Dogecoin maintains steady momentum without any significant news impact. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not affecting its market position. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a measured approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, BTC maintains a positive trend and bullish momentum. The news of Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings is supportive.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent sell pressure and whale movements suggest caution, but technical indicators remain positive. The potential for further downside warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical rebound and consistent on-chain activity suggest renewed bullish sentiment, making it relatively attractive in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall bullish sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-08-12 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, BTC maintains bullish technical indicators, and Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings could support future price recovery.

ETH: -0.3 — The potential sell-off by a whale and recent price decline suggest caution, despite bullish technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength after rebounding from the 200-day EMA suggests a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

2024-08-12 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with technical indicators showing bullish momentum across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE despite recent price declines. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable sell-offs, with BTC facing ETF outflows and ETH seeing potential whale sell-offs, which could introduce volatility. Solana shows technical resilience, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, while Dogecoin remains stable without significant news. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment. Tether remains stable amidst legal challenges, maintaining its role as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, BTC maintains bullish technical indicators. Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings could provide longer-term support.

ETH: -0.1 — The potential whale sell-off and recent price dip suggest caution. However, technicals remain bullish, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rebound from the 200-day EMA indicates technical strength and renewed bullish sentiment, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish signals in other assets and stable macro conditions, reduce USDT holdings to allocate more capital into riskier assets with potential upside."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum in recent hours despite some recent price dips. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant sell-offs, influenced by ETF outflows and whale movements, respectively. However, technical indicators for both suggest potential for recovery. Solana has shown technical strength by bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether is maintaining its stability despite legal challenges, indicating a steady position in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows and a price dip, technical indicators remain bullish, and Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings suggest confidence in future price appreciation.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent whale activity and a significant price drop indicate potential sell pressure, with on-chain indicators pointing to fading bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.6 — The bounce off the 200-day EMA suggests strong technical support and potential for further gains, supported by a stable market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, Dogecoin remains stable, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment leans towards risk-on, there's a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of potentially higher returns from other assets."
2024-08-12 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced recent price declines, with Bitcoin facing ETF outflows and Ethereum seeing significant whale movements potentially indicating sell-offs. However, technical indicators for Bitcoin remain bullish, and Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings may provide some support. Solana shows technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains bullish technical indicators. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not impacting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, technical indicators remain bullish, and Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings provide a positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent whale movements suggest potential sell pressure, and the price has dipped significantly, with bearish sentiment emerging.

SOL: +0.6 — The rebound from the 200-day EMA and positive technical indicators suggest renewed bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Although lacking significant news, Dogecoin maintains bullish technical indicators, warranting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed market conditions and no significant changes in risk appetite, maintaining a neutral stance on stablecoin holdings is prudent."
2024-08-13 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment for cryptocurrencies, with BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE all experiencing upward price movements and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, although there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings of a possible price drop. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could attract institutional interest. Solana has posted modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin continues to rise without significant news. However, there is a notable outflow of USDT from exchanges, suggesting a potential risk-off sentiment and reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox payouts, BTC's strong upward momentum and reduced selling pressure from stablecoin metrics support a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from staking developments and strong technical indicators make ETH attractive, especially with its growing role as a staking benchmark.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and positive momentum signal a cautiously optimistic outlook, though lacking strong buy signals compared to BTC and ETH.

DOGE: +0.2 — Continued price increase and positive technical indicators suggest a slight preference for holding, though lacking significant news catalysts.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate a shift towards riskier assets, suggesting a reduction in USDT holdings as market participants increase exposure to other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-13 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing upward price movement, but there is a warning of potential sell pressure that could lead to a significant price drop. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could enhance its appeal as a ""risk-free"" rate equivalent. Solana has posted modest gains and is leading the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating positive sentiment. Dogecoin shows consistent bullish momentum, although there is no significant news to further influence its price. Tether's large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, which could precede a downtrend in Bitcoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bullish momentum, caution is warranted due to potential sell pressure and the Mt. Gox distribution, which could increase volatility.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking narrative and bullish momentum make ETH attractive, with institutional interest in staking providing additional support.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive price movement and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest growing investor interest.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consistent bullish momentum without significant news suggests a moderate buy signal, but lack of news limits stronger conviction.

USDT: 0.0 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a mixed sentiment; maintaining a neutral stance as a hedge against potential market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most major cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing strong buy signals despite warnings of potential sell-offs due to Mt. Gox-related news. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking alternative, which could bolster its appeal among institutional investors. Solana (SOL) is leading the CoinDesk-20 index with modest gains, indicating strong market interest. Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks significant news but maintains bullish technical signals. Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) is seeing large outflows from exchanges, suggesting a potential risk-off sentiment and reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell-off warnings, BTC's technical indicators remain strong, and reduced selling pressure from stablecoin outflows could support price stability.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive developments in staking rates and institutional interest provide a strong foundation for ETH, supported by bullish technical indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — SOL's leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index and bullish momentum suggest moderate confidence in continued gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE has bullish technical signals, the lack of significant news or developments keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges and reduced selling pressure on BTC suggest a shift towards riskier assets, warranting a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-13 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a cautious outlook. Bitcoin is experiencing sell pressure, potentially leading to a significant price drop, as indicated by recent news and on-chain activity. Ethereum's staking is gaining traction as a benchmark rate, which could attract more institutional interest. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains bullish technical indicators. Tether's significant outflow from exchanges suggests a risk-off sentiment, with potential implications for Bitcoin's price stability. Overall, the market appears to be in a state of cautious optimism, with some assets showing resilience despite broader concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential for a significant price drop due to sell pressure and Mt. Gox-related news warrants caution. Reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.3 — The growing institutional interest in Ethereum staking as a benchmark rate provides a positive outlook, despite recent price declines.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index, along with bullish momentum, make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintaining the current position is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — The outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, making it a slightly more attractive option for capital preservation in uncertain market conditions."
2024-08-13 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with some bullish momentum in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, as indicated by their technical indicators. However, there is a looming bearish sentiment due to macroeconomic factors and news events, such as potential sell-offs and large outflows of USDT from exchanges, which could signal a risk-off environment. Bitcoin faces potential downward pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings of a possible $5K drop. Ethereum is seeing increased interest in staking as a benchmark rate, which could support its price stability. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin lacks significant news to influence its price direction. The reduction in stablecoin supply on exchanges suggests a decrease in selling pressure on BTC, but the large USDT outflow could indicate caution among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential for a significant drop due to Mt. Gox payouts and analyst warnings suggests caution is warranted.

ETH: +0.2 — Positive developments in staking and its perception as a benchmark rate provide some support, though recent price decreases suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate some positive momentum, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the potential risk-off environment and large outflows from exchanges, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins could provide stability amidst uncertainty."
2024-08-13 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and underlying bearish signals. Bitcoin is facing potential selling pressure, with warnings of a possible $5K drop due to seller dominance, compounded by the imminent Mt. Gox payout which could increase market volatility. Ethereum shows strong institutional interest in staking, positioning its yield as a benchmark rate, which may support its price stability. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating some positive sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a risk-off sentiment, potentially signaling a shift towards safer assets or cash holdings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technicals, significant selling pressure and potential Mt. Gox-related volatility warrant caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Institutional interest in staking and stable technical indicators provide moderate support, though recent sell pressure tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price movement and leading index performance suggest relative strength, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in technical indicators keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.1 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a potential risk-off environment, warranting a slight increase in stablecoin holdings for safety."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight upward momentum despite some bearish news. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing significant on-chain activity and bullish technical indicators, but there are concerns about potential sell-offs due to Mt. Gox-related developments and analyst warnings. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could support its price, but recent technical indicators are mixed. Solana (SOL) is leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, reflecting positive sentiment. Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether (USDT) is experiencing large outflows from exchanges, suggesting a potential risk-off sentiment, yet this could also indicate a rotation into other cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bullish technicals, the potential for a significant sell-off due to Mt. Gox-related news tempers enthusiasm. Maintain a cautious positive stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Growing institutional interest in staking supports a modestly positive outlook, though technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.5 — Leading gains in the broader market with positive sentiment and technical indicators, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-13 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish technical indicators for BTC and SOL, despite some bearish news for BTC regarding potential sell pressure. Ethereum's staking developments are gaining traction, which could support its price stability. Solana is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a neutral to slightly positive risk appetite. However, the large outflow of USDT from exchanges signals potential risk-off sentiment, indicating caution in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bearish news about potential sell pressure, BTC's technical indicators remain strong, with bullish momentum and high on-chain activity. However, caution is warranted due to the Mt. Gox news.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's staking developments are positive, and while technicals are neutral, the growing perception of staking as a ""risk-free"" rate supports a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is showing strong technical signals and leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, suggesting a favorable environment for further capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — The significant outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential shift in risk sentiment, warranting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-13 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum, but news of potential sell pressure and Mt. Gox payouts could introduce volatility. Ethereum's staking developments are positive, but technical indicators are neutral. Solana is showing modest gains and bullish momentum, suggesting potential for further upside. Dogecoin lacks significant news and shows no clear directional momentum. Meanwhile, USDT's significant outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating a shift towards holding more stable assets like BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox news, strong on-chain activity and bullish technical indicators suggest maintaining exposure with caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Positive developments in staking as a benchmark rate are encouraging, though technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish momentum and recent gains in the broader index support a favorable outlook for Solana, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate a potential shift towards risk assets, suggesting a slight reduction in USDT holdings to capitalize on potential market opportunities."
2024-08-13 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin facing potential sell pressure and a possible $5K decline, as noted by analysts. The Mt. Gox payout wallet's activity could also introduce volatility. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which may attract institutional interest. Solana is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index. Meanwhile, Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off environment, which could precede a Bitcoin downtrend. Overall, the macroeconomic environment is stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, but the potential for increased volatility in the crypto market remains.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the potential for a significant price drop due to sell pressure and Mt. Gox-related news suggests caution.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are neutral, the growing interest in Ethereum staking as a benchmark rate is a positive long-term development.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's modest gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate relative strength, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — The large outflows from exchanges and potential risk-off sentiment suggest maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, particularly for BTC. The macroeconomic context shows stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggesting a relatively calm broader market environment. However, BTC faces potential downside risks due to increased sell pressure and the impending Mt. Gox payout, which could introduce additional supply into the market. ETH is seeing increased interest in staking as a benchmark rate, which could provide some support. SOL is showing resilience with modest gains, while DOGE lacks significant news or momentum. USDT is experiencing large outflows, which could indicate a risk-off sentiment and potential pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox payouts and bearish analyst predictions suggest caution. Current holdings should be reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Growing interest in staking as a benchmark rate provides some support, but technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest a slight positive bias, warranting a small increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical momentum keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.5 — Large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, making USDT a safer allocation in the current environment."
2024-08-13 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with slight bearish undertones, particularly for Bitcoin, as analysts warn of potential declines due to seller dominance and the impending Mt. Gox BTC distribution. Ethereum shows a more stable outlook with growing institutional interest in staking, suggesting a potential floor for ETH prices. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, which could indicate relative strength. Dogecoin remains quiet with no significant news, while Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a risk-off sentiment, potentially signaling reduced selling pressure on BTC but also a cautious stance from investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the potential for a significant price drop due to sell pressure and the Mt. Gox distribution creates a cautious outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Institutional interest in staking and the introduction of a new staking benchmark provide a supportive backdrop, though technicals remain neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Leading the CoinDesk-20 index with modest gains and maintaining bullish momentum, suggesting relative strength in a cautious market.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral.

USDT: +0.3 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a risk-off sentiment, suggesting a preference for holding stable assets amid potential market volatility."
2024-08-13 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects a mixed sentiment with slight bearish undertones for Bitcoin, as indicated by the potential for a $5K drop due to seller dominance and the Mt. Gox BTC distribution, which could increase selling pressure. Ethereum shows promising developments with growing institutional interest in staking, positioning it as a stable yield alternative. Solana has demonstrated modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, suggesting relative strength. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating a shift towards holding or accumulating BTC, despite the bearish news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent price increase, bearish news and potential selling pressure from Mt. Gox distribution suggest caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Growing interest in staking and new benchmark developments provide a positive outlook, but technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price movement and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate relative strength and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.1 — Despite large outflows, maintaining a slight preference for liquidity in a potentially volatile market environment."
2024-08-13 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward price movements across major cryptocurrencies in the last few hours. Bitcoin has shown some recovery in price, but faces potential downside risks due to sell pressure and the impending Mt. Gox payouts. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could bolster its appeal to institutional investors. Solana has posted modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating some positive momentum. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market is experiencing significant outflows, particularly USDT, which could signal a shift towards risk-off sentiment or increased BTC accumulation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox payouts and analyst warnings of a decline suggest caution. The current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — The growing interest in Ethereum staking as a benchmark rate and the introduction of CESR™ provide a positive outlook. This, coupled with stable price movements, warrants a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive price movement and leading position in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate strong momentum. The bullish technical signals support an increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining the current position in Dogecoin is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite the outflows, the current macroeconomic environment and potential BTC sell-off suggest maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin reserve for flexibility."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL. However, there are warnings of potential sell-offs, particularly for BTC, due to increased sell pressure and significant outflows of USDT from exchanges, which often precede downtrends. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking alternative, suggesting institutional interest, although its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana shows positive momentum, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while DOGE lacks significant news or technical signals. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no drastic changes in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite recent price increases, warnings of potential sell-offs and significant USDT outflows suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to mitigate risk.

**ETH: 0.0** — Mixed technical signals and neutral news sentiment. Hold current position as staking interest grows but lacks immediate bullish momentum.

**SOL: +0.5** — Positive momentum and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index. Increasing allocation slightly to capitalize on upward trends.

**DOGE: 0.0** — No significant news or technical changes. Maintain current position without adjustments.

**USDT: +0.2** — Despite outflows, maintaining a slightly higher allocation as a hedge against potential market downturns indicated by BTC sentiment."
2024-08-13 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing sell pressure, with potential downside risks highlighted by analysts, including a possible $5K decline. However, on-chain activity remains robust, indicating some underlying interest. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking asset, with new benchmarks being introduced, which could enhance its appeal to institutional investors. Solana is showing positive momentum, leading the CoinDesk-20 index with modest gains. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news impacting its market dynamics. Meanwhile, USDT is witnessing significant outflows from exchanges, suggesting a potential risk-off sentiment and reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish on-chain activity, significant sell pressure and potential downside risks warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Growing institutional interest in staking and new benchmark introductions provide a supportive backdrop, though technicals remain neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest a favorable outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or market activity keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.1 — While outflows suggest reduced selling pressure on BTC, maintaining a slight preference for liquidity amid mixed market signals."
2024-08-13 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable price increases across major cryptocurrencies in the last hour, indicating potential bullish momentum. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge, breaking above the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting a possible breakout, despite some bearish news regarding potential sell pressure and Mt. Gox-related distribution. Ethereum shows bullish momentum but lacks a clear trend signal, with growing interest in its staking as a benchmark rate. Solana has demonstrated consistent bullish signals and led gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin's technical indicators remain mixed without significant news impact. Meanwhile, USDT has seen substantial outflows from exchanges, potentially signaling a risk-off sentiment, although it maintains bullish technical indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox news, BTC shows strong upward momentum and significant price increase, suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and growing interest in staking as a benchmark rate provide moderate support, but lack of a clear trend signal tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.6 — Consistent bullish signals and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index make SOL an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical indicators and lack of significant news provide no clear direction for DOGE, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest a potential shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for high USDT exposure in the portfolio."
2024-08-13 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin has experienced significant price increases and on-chain activity, but there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could enhance its appeal to institutional investors. Solana continues to lead gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating strong market interest. Dogecoin has shown some positive momentum but lacks significant news to drive further interest. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market, particularly USDT, is experiencing large outflows, suggesting a potential risk-off sentiment and reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the bullish momentum and price breakout, caution is warranted due to potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox distributions and analyst warnings.

ETH: +0.5 — Growing institutional interest in staking and recent price stability support a modestly positive outlook, though technical signals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and leading performance in the broader index suggest continued upward potential, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some bullish momentum, the lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges and reduced selling pressure on BTC indicate a shift towards risk assets, justifying a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-13 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with some bullish momentum observed in BTC, ETH, and SOL, as indicated by positive technical indicators and recent price increases. However, the macroeconomic environment, including a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and a stable S&P 500, suggests cautious optimism. Notably, BTC faces potential sell pressure due to upcoming Mt. Gox distributions, and significant USDT outflows from exchanges could signal a risk-off environment. Ethereum's staking developments are positive, potentially attracting more institutional interest. Overall, the market is experiencing a cautious optimism with potential headwinds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox distributions and analyst warnings of a $5K drop warrant caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive developments in staking and institutional interest provide a supportive backdrop, although technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators result in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite recent outflows, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given potential market volatility and risk-off signals."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum, though there is a warning of potential sell pressure due to Mt. Gox-related developments. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, indicating institutional interest, while Solana (SOL) is leading gains in the broader index. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains relatively stable with no significant news. Tether (USDT) shows a large outflow from exchanges, suggesting a risk-off sentiment and potential capital rotation into cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox developments, BTC shows strong momentum and on-chain activity, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest in staking and positive technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for ETH, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive performance in the broader index and strong technical signals justify a moderate buy signal for SOL.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — The significant outflow from exchanges and potential capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-13 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a steady U.S. dollar index, which generally supports risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the elevated volatility index suggests potential market turbulence. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows mixed signals with bullish momentum but potential downside risks due to sell pressure and Mt. Gox-related news. Ethereum remains strong with increased staking activity seen as a positive long-term trend. Solana shows modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating relative strength. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. The substantial outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a risk-off sentiment, potentially indicating caution in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential $5K drop and Mt. Gox news introduce downside risk, warranting a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking activity and new benchmark developments support a positive outlook, making it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest relative strength, justifying a moderate positive score.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — While outflows suggest caution, maintaining a moderate stablecoin position provides a hedge against potential market volatility."
2024-08-13 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

However, macroeconomic conditions present a mixed backdrop, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX suggesting a stable yet uncertain broader market environment. Bitcoin faces potential downward pressure due to significant sell signals and news of Mt. Gox BTC distributions, which could increase supply. Ethereum shows strength in its staking narrative, potentially attracting institutional interest. Solana leads gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating strong performance relative to peers. Meanwhile, significant USDT outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, which could impact BTC negatively.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technicals, the potential for a $5K drop and Mt. Gox-related sell pressure warrant caution. Current holdings should be reduced slightly.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking narrative and institutional interest provide a positive outlook. Technicals remain bullish, supporting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index and maintaining bullish momentum. Positive sentiment justifies a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest holding current positions without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a risk-off sentiment, suggesting reduced exposure as capital rotates into more volatile assets."
2024-08-13 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. dollar index remains elevated, which could exert pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin faces potential downside risk due to significant sell pressure and the looming Mt. Gox distribution, which might lead to increased supply in the market. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, indicating growing institutional interest. Solana shows positive momentum, leading gains in the broader crypto index. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news. Tether's large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, which could lead to increased volatility in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential $5K drop and Mt. Gox distribution pose significant downside risk. Current holdings should be reduced cautiously.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from staking developments and institutional interest supports a modest increase in allocation, despite slight price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.5 — Leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index and strong technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for further capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current position is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — The large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential increase in market volatility, warranting a slight increase in stablecoin holdings to hedge against risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. dollar and relatively high gold prices, indicating a cautious market sentiment. In the crypto space, technical indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest bullish momentum, supported by positive trend signals. However, BTC faces potential downside risks due to increased sell pressure and concerns related to the Mt. Gox payout. Ethereum continues to gain traction in staking, which is seen as a positive long-term development. Solana is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news. USDT has experienced significant outflows from exchanges, which could signal a risk-off sentiment and potential BTC downtrends.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential for a $5K drop due to sell pressure and Mt. Gox-related concerns warrants a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking growth and the introduction of a new staking benchmark enhance ETH's attractiveness as a long-term hold.

SOL: +0.4 — Leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index and maintaining bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in technical indicators suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite outflows, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation could hedge against potential market volatility and BTC's downside risk."
2024-08-14 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals observed in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin's market is buoyed by institutional interest, as evidenced by significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks, suggesting growing confidence and potential price support. Ethereum's transition to an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades reflect mixed sentiment but also potential for future growth. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and technical patterns that could lead to significant price movements. Meanwhile, DOGE lacks significant news but maintains bullish technical indicators. Tether's substantial outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity, possibly indicating increased risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and strong technical indicators suggest a bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades and continued bullish momentum support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout justify a favorable allocation, despite mixed sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and consistent low on-chain activity suggest maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows and increased risk appetite in the market suggest reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-14 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is seeing increased institutional interest through spot-ETF investments, suggesting growing confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum is experiencing a shift toward inflationary supply, which could dampen its price momentum despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana's network activity is at record highs, indicating strong user engagement, although its price is at a critical support level. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and new minting on Ethereum suggest shifts in liquidity, possibly indicating a move toward riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investments and miner activity suggest a potential price bottom, combined with strong technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical upgrades are promising, the shift to inflationary supply tempers enthusiasm. Still, bullish momentum persists.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout support a positive outlook, despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings aligns with current market conditions."
2024-08-14 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a cautiously optimistic sentiment with Bitcoin and Ethereum displaying bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Institutional interest in Bitcoin, as evidenced by major banks increasing their ETF positions, suggests growing confidence in the asset. Ethereum's transition to an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades may influence its market dynamics. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, indicating strong network usage, although price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a stable position. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and increased minting on Ethereum reflect liquidity shifts, possibly indicating a repositioning of capital in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. The potential bottoming event adds to the positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades and consistent bullish momentum support a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — High on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout provide a slightly positive outlook, though price direction remains uncertain.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.5 — Large outflows and increased minting indicate a shift in liquidity, suggesting reduced exposure as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-14 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and potential miner capitulation signaling a price bottom. Ethereum, however, faces mixed sentiment due to its shift towards inflationary supply despite upcoming developer-friendly upgrades. Solana's network activity is at record highs, suggesting potential for growth, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, indicating a neutral stance. Tether's recent large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity, possibly indicating increased risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and potential miner capitulation suggest a bullish outlook, supported by positive technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite inflationary concerns, technical indicators remain bullish, and upcoming upgrades could enhance long-term value.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and technical developments provide a positive outlook, though price direction uncertainty tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.5 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a shift towards riskier assets, suggesting reduced exposure to stablecoins."
2024-08-14 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong buy signals supported by technical indicators and positive news developments. Bitcoin's institutional adoption through spot ETFs and miner activity suggests a potential price bottom. Ethereum's upcoming Pectra fork and recent shift to inflationary supply indicate mixed but potentially positive long-term prospects. Solana's network activity is robust, though its price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news and shows mixed technical signals. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity preferences, possibly indicating a move towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and institutional interest through ETF investments suggest a bullish outlook, with potential for price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming Pectra fork and strong technical signals support a moderately positive stance.

SOL: +0.3 — High on-chain activity and potential for performance improvements through upgrades provide a cautiously optimistic view, despite uncertain price direction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest reduced demand for stablecoins as investors possibly rotate into riskier assets, warranting a slight reduction in exposure."
2024-08-14 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with notable institutional interest in Bitcoin, as evidenced by significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks. This suggests growing confidence in Bitcoin's potential, despite recent miner capitulation indicating a possible price bottom. Ethereum's shift towards an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades highlight mixed sentiment, with potential long-term benefits from the Pectra fork. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, suggesting strong network usage, although price direction remains uncertain. Tether's significant outflows from exchanges and new issuances indicate shifts in liquidity dynamics, reflecting potential changes in investor risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional investments and potential bottoming signals from miner activity suggest a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades could enhance long-term value, justifying a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout support a moderate increase in allocation, despite mixed price sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustments.

USDT: -0.4 — The large outflows and new issuances suggest a shift away from stablecoins as investors potentially seek higher-risk assets, supporting a reduction in allocation."
2024-08-14 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with institutional interest in Bitcoin through ETFs suggesting growing confidence in the asset. Bitcoin's miner capitulation could indicate a price bottom, potentially signaling a bullish reversal. Ethereum is experiencing a shift towards inflationary supply, but upcoming technical upgrades may bolster its appeal. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, but price direction remains uncertain, with potential for both upward and downward movements. Tether's significant outflows from exchanges suggest liquidity shifts, while new minting on Ethereum indicates ongoing demand for stablecoins. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional adoption through ETFs and potential price bottom signals a strong buy opportunity, supported by positive on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite inflationary supply concerns, technical upgrades and consistent bullish momentum provide a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout warrant a cautious buy, though price direction remains uncertain.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a hold position with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.3 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate reduced demand for stablecoins, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-14 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest in Bitcoin through significant ETF investments, suggesting growing confidence in the asset. Bitcoin's miner capitulation could indicate a potential price bottom, adding a bullish undertone. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply might dampen its appeal slightly, though upcoming technical upgrades could provide long-term benefits. Solana's network activity is robust, with potential for a breakout, but mixed sentiment suggests caution. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges indicate a shift in liquidity, but recent minting on Ethereum suggests continued market demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investment and potential bottoming signals from miner activity provide a strong bullish case, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite inflationary concerns, bullish momentum and upcoming technical upgrades support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout suggest a favorable allocation, though mixed sentiment advises caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position, with no strong reason to adjust holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — While stablecoin demand remains, the large outflows from exchanges suggest a slight reduction in allocation as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-14 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable outlook, with moderate volatility and a steady S&P 500 index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is showing signs of institutional interest with significant investments in spot ETFs, which could bolster confidence and support price stability. Ethereum's transition to an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades may introduce short-term uncertainty but also potential long-term growth. Solana's network activity is robust, indicating strong usage and potential for price appreciation, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a cautious liquidity environment, though recent minting indicates ongoing demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional adoption through spot ETFs and miner capitulation signals suggest potential for price stability and growth, making BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming Pectra fork and continued bullish momentum support a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and technical signals suggest potential for price appreciation, supported by network upgrades.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral stance, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — While stablecoin demand remains, the large outflows from exchanges suggest a slight reduction in preference as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-14 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals, particularly for Ethereum and Solana, while Bitcoin experiences institutional interest through ETF investments. Ethereum's transition to an inflationary supply and upcoming Pectra fork could influence its market dynamics. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, suggesting potential for further price movement. Meanwhile, Tether's significant outflows from exchanges indicate a liquidity shift, possibly reflecting changing risk appetites. Overall, the market seems cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward momentum in select assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs suggests growing confidence, combined with a potential bottoming event due to miner capitulation. However, lack of strong momentum signals tempers the score.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming Pectra fork and consistent bullish momentum signals support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum signals, alongside technical indicators suggesting a potential breakout, make Solana particularly attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity and risk appetite, warranting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-14 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a recent downturn in prices across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite this, there are positive developments such as institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and record on-chain activity for Solana, suggesting potential bullish sentiment in the longer term. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and recent price breakdowns indicate caution, while Tether's significant outflows and minting activities reflect shifting liquidity dynamics. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious with potential for recovery, but immediate bearish pressures are evident.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest potential for a price bottom, but recent price decline warrants caution.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply concerns and recent price drop, balanced by developer-friendly upgrades on the horizon.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, supported by network upgrades, make it relatively attractive despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: -0.1 — Lack of significant news and recent price breakdown suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and recent outflows, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation for liquidity and risk management is prudent."
2024-08-14 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs are positive, but recent miner capitulation and price breakdown warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite the shift towards inflationary supply, upcoming technical upgrades and continued buy signals support a slightly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout make Solana an attractive option, though mixed sentiment suggests monitoring closely.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and technical signals keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — Recent outflows and increased minting suggest a cautious approach, with potential capital rotation into riskier assets."
2024-08-14 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies, with significant recent price declines for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. BTC and ETH are experiencing technical breakdowns, with BTC's price below the lower Bollinger Band and miner capitulation suggesting a potential bottom. Institutional interest in BTC through ETFs indicates long-term confidence. ETH's transition to an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades may impact its attractiveness. SOL shows strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, though its price is near a critical support level. DOGE lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. USDT's large outflows from exchanges and recent minting on Ethereum suggest liquidity shifts, possibly indicating cautious sentiment in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest via ETFs and miner capitulation suggest potential for a price bottom, despite current technical weakness.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply concerns balanced by upcoming technical upgrades; holding position is prudent.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout support increased allocation, despite recent price declines.

DOGE: -0.2 — Lack of significant news and technical weakness suggest reducing exposure slightly, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges and increased minting indicate a shift in liquidity preference, suggesting reduced allocation as risk appetite may increase."
2024-08-14 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest with significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting a potential bottoming event despite recent miner capitulation. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades present a mixed outlook, with no strong bullish momentum evident. Solana is witnessing record on-chain activity, indicating robust network engagement, though price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and increased issuance on Ethereum highlight shifts in liquidity and potential market caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and miner outflows suggest a potential price bottom, warranting increased allocation despite recent technical weakness.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from inflationary supply and technical upgrades balance each other out, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout make Solana relatively attractive, despite mixed sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased liquidity and market caution, maintaining a moderate allocation in USDT is prudent, but some capital rotation into more promising assets is justified."
2024-08-14 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest with major banks investing in spot ETFs, although miner capitulation suggests potential bottoming. Ethereum's shift to an inflationary supply could weigh on its price, despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana is showing strong on-chain activity and technical patterns that could lead to a breakout. Tether's significant outflows from exchanges indicate a shift in liquidity, possibly reflecting a cautious stance among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest a potential bottom and increased confidence, making BTC relatively attractive despite current technical weakness.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's shift to inflationary supply and lack of strong technical signals balance out the potential positive impact of upcoming network upgrades, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout make Solana an attractive option, supported by positive network developments and usage.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, DOGE remains neutral, lacking clear catalysts for movement.

USDT: -0.3 — The outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a decrease in demand for stablecoins, aligning with a potential increase in risk appetite, warranting a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-14 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bearish indicators across major cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC and ETH, which are experiencing downward price pressure and lack of bullish technical signals. However, there is notable institutional interest in Bitcoin through spot ETFs, suggesting potential long-term confidence. Solana shows promising on-chain activity and technical patterns that could indicate a breakout, despite recent price declines. Meanwhile, Tether has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating a potential shift in liquidity preferences, although it remains a stable option in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and bearish technicals, institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs suggests underlying strength and potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum's shift to inflationary supply and lack of strong bullish signals suggest caution, though upcoming technical upgrades could provide future support.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout make Solana an attractive option, despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: +0.2 — While there are significant outflows, maintaining a stablecoin position provides a hedge against volatility and offers liquidity for potential buying opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest in Bitcoin, as evidenced by major banks increasing their positions in Bitcoin ETFs. This institutional adoption could signal a potential bottoming event for Bitcoin, especially given the recent miner capitulation. Ethereum, on the other hand, faces mixed sentiment due to its shift towards inflationary supply, although upcoming technical upgrades could provide a longer-term bullish outlook. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, though its price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, indicating a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether's substantial outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity preferences, possibly indicating a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional adoption and miner capitulation suggest a potential bottom, making BTC relatively attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from inflationary supply concerns and upcoming technical upgrades result in a neutral stance for ETH.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout support a modest positive allocation, despite uncertain price direction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral allocation for DOGE.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate a potential rotation out of stablecoins, suggesting reduced exposure to USDT."
2024-08-14 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across different assets. Bitcoin is seeing increased institutional interest with significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks, suggesting growing confidence in the asset. However, miner capitulation could indicate a potential price bottom, which adds uncertainty. Ethereum is experiencing a shift towards inflationary supply, which may dampen investor enthusiasm despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana is showing strong on-chain activity, which could support future price increases, but the market remains uncertain with mixed technical signals. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and subsequent minting on Ethereum suggest shifts in liquidity and investor positioning.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and potential miner capitulation suggest a supportive environment for BTC, despite current technical indicators not signaling a buy.

ETH: 0.0 — The shift towards inflationary supply and lack of strong bullish signals from technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, despite upcoming technical upgrades.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout provide a positive outlook, though mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — The large outflows from exchanges and increased minting suggest a potential decrease in demand for stablecoins as investors may be rotating into other assets."
2024-08-14 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic, with some positive developments in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, as evidenced by major banks increasing their positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This suggests growing confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential. However, the overall technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals not showing bullish momentum. Ethereum's shift towards an inflationary supply and Solana's mixed technical signals contribute to a more uncertain outlook. Meanwhile, significant USDT outflows from exchanges indicate a potential shift in liquidity preferences, possibly reflecting a cautious stance among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest a potential bottoming event, providing a cautiously optimistic outlook despite current bearish technicals.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply concerns and no clear bullish momentum, balanced by upcoming network upgrades that could enhance long-term value.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout, though technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderately positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges and recent minting on Ethereum suggest a shift in liquidity preferences, indicating a reduced need for stablecoin holdings as risk appetite may be increasing slightly."
2024-08-14 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with no clear bullish momentum across major assets. Bitcoin's recent ETF-related news suggests growing institutional interest, which could support its price, although miner capitulation indicates potential bottoming. Ethereum's shift to inflationary supply and upcoming network upgrades present mixed signals. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, hinting at potential growth, though price direction remains uncertain. Tether's significant outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity preferences, while new minting on Ethereum increases market liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Institutional interest through ETF investments is a positive sign, and miner capitulation may indicate a price bottom, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

**ETH: 0.0** — Mixed signals from inflationary supply and upcoming upgrades create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

**SOL: +0.3** — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout provide a moderately positive outlook, despite uncertain price direction.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral position, maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

**USDT: +0.2** — Despite outflows from exchanges, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given the overall market uncertainty and potential for volatility."

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and a stable U.S. dollar index, suggesting a neutral risk sentiment in broader markets. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies indicates a lack of strong bullish signals, with all major assets showing short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD indicators below their signal lines. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price dip, reflecting broader market sell-offs, while Ethereum is facing potential bearish technical patterns. Despite this, Ethereum is holding above key support levels, which might provide some resilience. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, while Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Maintain exposure but reduce slightly due to broader market sell-off.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish technical patterns, ETH is holding key support levels. Maintain current exposure as potential rebound is possible.

SOL: +0.2 — No significant news, but slight price increases and stable on-chain activity suggest moderate potential for gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall lack of bullish signals in other assets and potential regulatory risks, maintain higher exposure to USDT for stability and liquidity."
2024-08-15 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip under $58K and Ethereum showing signs of potential further decline due to a bearish technical pattern. Market indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with technical signals pointing to sideways or downward trends. Despite some activity surges in Bitcoin on-chain data, the broader market remains cautious, with no significant positive news driving sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The market sentiment is bearish, and there's no strong catalyst for a rebound.

ETH: -0.4 — The bearish 'rising wedge' pattern and oversold conditions indicate potential further downside, warranting reduced exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a change in allocation. Maintain current position until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position without change.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safer position amidst potential volatility."
2024-08-15 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines and lack of strong buy signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop below $58K, reflecting broader market sell-offs. Ethereum is showing mixed signals with a bearish pattern identified, though it remains above key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, although it is expanding its adoption in new regions. Overall, the macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly bearish environment, encouraging a more conservative approach with a preference for stable assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The broader market sell-off adds to the bearish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish patterns, ETH holds above key support levels, indicating potential stability. Mixed technical signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.1 — No significant news, but stable on-chain activity and slight price recovery suggest a modest positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2024-08-15 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed, with notable volatility and uncertainty across the crypto space.

Ethereum faces bearish technical patterns but holds critical support levels, suggesting potential for a rebound.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and sideways futures trading suggest caution. Despite increased on-chain activity, the lack of bullish technical signals warrants a conservative stance.

ETH: 0.0 — While technical indicators show potential for a rebound, the bearish pattern and mixed news sentiment suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing risk.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite no significant news, stable price movements and normal on-chain activity indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining current holdings is prudent given the lack of clear directional signals.

USDT: +0.2 — Regulatory concerns are offset by its role as a safe haven amid market volatility, suggesting a slight increase in stablecoin exposure to manage risk."

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent dip in Bitcoin's price and the lack of strong bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price drop, reflecting broader market sell-offs, while Ethereum is facing technical bearish patterns despite holding key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have shown minimal price movement and lack significant news catalysts. Meanwhile, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, although it is expanding its adoption in new markets. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a neutral to cautious approach, with a potential preference for stablecoins in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the broader market's cautious sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — While technical indicators show bearish patterns, ETH is holding key support levels, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable price movements, maintaining a neutral position is prudent in the absence of strong directional signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight bullish momentum signal, the lack of significant news or technical developments supports a neutral allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2024-08-15 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip below $58K amid broader crypto market sell-offs. This has led to choppy and sideways trading, reflecting limited conviction among traders. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, though it remains near a key support level, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but both show normal activity levels without clear bullish signals. Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability and adoption. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggest a relatively stable external environment, though the crypto market is experiencing internal volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and sideways trading indicate cautious sentiment. High on-chain activity suggests some interest, but overall market conditions are not supportive of a strong buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish technical patterns, ETH is holding a key support level, balancing potential downside with a chance for a rebound. Mixed signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.1 — No significant news or technical signals, but the asset's recent price decrease could present a minor buying opportunity if broader market conditions improve.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing or decreasing holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory concerns, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential downturns in other crypto assets."
2024-08-15 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable decline below $58,000, accompanied by a broader crypto market sell-off. This downturn is reflected in the technical indicators, which show no strong buy signals across major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is facing potential downside risks due to a bearish pattern, although it remains above a key support level, suggesting some potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news or technical changes, while Tether faces regulatory scrutiny but continues to expand its adoption. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility, which might encourage a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The market sentiment is bearish, and the on-chain activity surge may indicate selling pressure.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite holding above a key support level, the bearish pattern and oversold conditions warrant a cautious stance, with potential for a rebound not yet confirmed.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to suggest a change in allocation. The recent price decrease aligns with the broader market sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some bullish momentum, the lack of significant news or technical changes suggests maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the bearish market sentiment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT can provide a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-15 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent dip in Bitcoin's price and the broader crypto market sell-off. Bitcoin's price has been fluctuating with no clear directional conviction, and Ethereum is facing potential downside risks due to a bearish technical pattern. Solana and Dogecoin have shown slight price movements without significant news, while Tether faces regulatory scrutiny that could impact its stability. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the broader market sell-off and sideways trading in futures.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions indicate potential further downside, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or strong technical signals to justify a change in allocation; maintain current exposure.

DOGE: 0.1 — Despite no major news, bullish momentum in technical indicators suggests a slight increase in allocation could be beneficial.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in the broader market, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin exposure provides a safe haven amidst uncertainty."
2024-08-15 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines and the lack of strong technical buy signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has recently experienced a notable dip below $58K, reflecting broader market sell-offs and limited directional conviction. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, though it remains near a key support level, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven changes, while USDT faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. On-chain activity is high, but overall sentiment remains weak.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions indicate potential downside risk, though key support may offer some stability.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a strong allocation decision. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — Bullish momentum persists, but without significant news, the potential for upward movement is limited.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a hedge against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip below $58K, reflecting broader crypto market sell-offs. Despite this, there is no strong directional conviction, as evidenced by sideways futures trading. Ethereum is showing mixed signals, with a bearish pattern identified but also some support at the $2,623 level. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Dogecoin shows some bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether faces potential regulatory risks, although it is expanding its adoption in the Gulf region. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a neutral to slightly cautious stance, favoring a balanced approach between risk assets and stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain exposure but be wary of further downside.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and bearish news offset by support at key levels. Hold current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.1 — No significant news, but stable technicals and market activity suggest a slight positive bias. Small increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators, despite low on-chain activity. Slight preference for increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintain a higher allocation to USDT for stability and liquidity."
2024-08-15 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip below $58,000, reflecting broader market sell-offs. Ethereum is showing mixed signals, with a bearish technical pattern identified but also some support at key levels. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but their technical indicators suggest a lack of strong momentum. Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability and adoption, despite recent investments signaling expansion efforts. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with no significant shifts in key indicators like interest rates or the S&P 500, suggesting a neutral backdrop for crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and sideways futures trading indicate caution. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure amidst market uncertainty.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals with potential support at $2,623. Maintain current position as the market assesses direction.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position without changes.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite low activity, bullish momentum in MACD suggests a slight positive bias. Consider increasing exposure modestly.

USDT: +0.5 — Regulatory risks highlight the need for caution, but stablecoin's role as a safe haven supports maintaining or slightly increasing exposure in uncertain market conditions."
2024-08-15 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some signs of bullish momentum in Bitcoin and Dogecoin, while Ethereum shows potential bearish patterns. Bitcoin experienced a sharp dip recently, but on-chain activity remains robust, suggesting underlying interest. Ethereum is hovering near a critical support level, with potential for a rebound, though technical patterns indicate caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but show normal market activity. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, though it continues to expand its adoption footprint. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum signal a potential rebound. However, caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: -0.1 — Bearish technical patterns and mixed news sentiment suggest caution, though holding near support levels provides some stability.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance as the market activity remains normal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity provide a slight positive outlook, though lacking significant news.

USDT: +0.1 — Regulatory risks are a concern, but stablecoin demand remains steady in a mixed market environment, providing a safe haven."
2024-08-15 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip under $58K, reflecting broader market sell-offs, and is showing weak directional conviction in futures trading. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns but is holding a key support level, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Dogecoin shows some bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, though it is expanding its adoption in the Gulf region. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, does not provide strong directional cues for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and lack of strong bullish signals suggest reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite bearish patterns, ETH is holding key support with potential for a rebound, warranting a cautious hold.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators provides a slight positive bias, but no major news to drive strong conviction.

USDT: +0.4 — With market uncertainty and potential regulatory impacts on Tether, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure for risk management is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential breakout despite recent volatility and a significant price increase in the last hour. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals, with a bearish pattern identified but maintaining key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive price movements and bullish momentum, although without significant news to drive these changes. Tether remains stable, but faces potential regulatory risks, which could impact its attractiveness as a safe haven in the crypto market. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's significant price increase and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains. However, caution is warranted due to recent market dips.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a bearish pattern identified, but maintaining key support levels. The potential for a rebound exists, but uncertainty remains.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive price movement and bullish momentum, although lacking significant news. The asset shows potential for continued growth.

DOGE: +0.2 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum, but low on-chain activity and lack of news suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — Potential regulatory risks and recent capital rotation into riskier assets reduce the attractiveness of holding large stablecoin positions."
2024-08-15 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a recent price dip and choppy futures trading, indicating uncertainty among traders. Ethereum is showing signs of potential bearishness due to a detected rising wedge pattern, although it remains above key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive price movements and bullish momentum, with no significant news affecting their outlook. Tether faces regulatory risks, but its recent investment in a Kuwaiti fintech suggests ongoing efforts to expand USDT adoption. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodity prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dip and sideways futures trading, BTC shows bullish momentum and a buy signal in the latest hour, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a bearish pattern identified but holding key support levels. Uncertainty in direction warrants a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price movement and bullish momentum without any negative news, indicating a favorable outlook for further gains.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and a buy signal, coupled with a potential breakout, make DOGE an attractive asset for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-15 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum despite recent volatility and mixed news. Bitcoin's recent price increase and bullish momentum indicators suggest potential upward movement, although recent news highlights some market uncertainty. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with a bearish pattern identified, but it remains above key support levels, indicating potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive price movements and bullish momentum, though without significant news to drive sentiment. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its attractiveness as a safe haven in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential breakout above the upper Bollinger Band suggest a favorable outlook. However, cautious sentiment from recent news tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technical indicators show bullish momentum, but the potential bearish pattern and recent news about a possible drop warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consistent upward price movement and bullish momentum indicators support a modestly positive outlook, although the lack of significant news keeps the score moderate.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential breakout signals, making it relatively attractive despite the absence of major news.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, reducing exposure to USDT seems prudent, especially given the regulatory concerns highlighted in recent news."
2024-08-15 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent significant price decreases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, despite previously bullish momentum signals. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, reflecting broader market sell-offs, while Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, though it remains near key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but both have shown price declines. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but faces potential regulatory risks, which could impact its future stability and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, BTC maintains bullish momentum signals and increased on-chain activity, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price declines indicate caution, though it remains near support levels, which could limit downside risk.

SOL: +0.1 — While lacking significant news, SOL's price decline is less concerning due to ongoing bullish momentum signals, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed price signals, DOGE remains neutral, lacking clear directional conviction.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the recent market volatility and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a stablecoin position offers a hedge against further market downturns."
2024-08-15 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent dip below $58,000 reflects broader market sell-offs, while Ethereum is facing technical challenges with a potential bearish pattern identified. Despite some bullish momentum in the past, the recent significant price drops and technical breakdowns suggest a cautious approach. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is facing regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its future adoption and stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, BTC maintains bullish momentum signals and a buy trend, suggesting potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted given the broader market sell-off.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish technical patterns and recent significant price drops indicate potential further downside. The oversold condition offers some hope for a rebound, but risks remain high.

SOL: +0.2 — While SOL has experienced a significant price decrease, it maintains a buy trend signal. The lack of significant news and recent technical breakdowns suggest a cautious, but slightly positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.1 — DOGE has seen significant price declines and technical breakdowns, with no supportive news to counteract the bearish sentiment. A slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven. Regulatory risks are noted, but the stability of USDT remains appealing in the current environment."
2024-08-15 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. This decline is accompanied by a lack of strong directional conviction, as indicated by sideways trading patterns and bearish technical signals. Bitcoin's recent plunge below $58K and Ethereum's bearish rising wedge pattern highlight the market's vulnerability to further downside. However, despite the bearish sentiment, USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market downturns. Regulatory concerns surrounding Tether could impact its stability, but its recent investment in Kuwaiti fintech suggests ongoing efforts to expand adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent sharp decline and bearish market sentiment, coupled with sideways futures trading, suggest a cautious approach. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.4 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions indicate potential further downside. Reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines, the lack of significant news and mixed technical signals warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and bearish technical indicators, maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-08-15 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. This downturn is reflected in the macroeconomic context, where volatility remains moderate, and traditional safe-haven assets like gold are performing strongly. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop below $58K, with futures trading showing limited directional conviction. Ethereum is facing technical challenges, with a potential bearish pattern identified, though it remains near key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have not seen significant news, but their technical indicators suggest potential breakdowns. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, though regulatory concerns could impact its future stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some buy signals from technical indicators, the recent price decline and lack of strong directional conviction in futures trading suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly may be prudent given current market conditions.

ETH: -0.4 — The bearish technical pattern and recent price declines indicate potential further downside. Reducing exposure aligns with the current sentiment and technical outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — While there is no significant news, the mixed technical signals and slight price recovery suggest a neutral stance. Holding current positions seems appropriate.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is advisable. The recent price decline warrants caution, but no strong sell signal is present.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer. Despite regulatory concerns, its stability is attractive in the current environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a recent dip in prices across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, which have experienced significant decreases. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, with a recent sharp decline, reflecting broader market sell-offs. Ethereum is showing signs of bearish technical patterns, although it remains near key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have seen price decreases but lack significant news to drive sentiment changes. Tether remains stable but faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its future stability. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines, BTC's technical indicators show mixed signals with no clear direction, suggesting a hold position.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price declines suggest reducing exposure, though it remains near support levels.

SOL: +0.1 — Slight recovery in price and normal on-chain activity, but lacking strong momentum or news to drive a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins for risk management is prudent."
2024-08-15 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a recent sharp decline below $58,000, indicating potential bearishness in the short term. Ethereum is also showing signs of weakness, with a bearish pattern identified, though it remains above key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have shown slight price increases, but without significant news or strong technical signals. Tether remains stable, though regulatory concerns could impact its future stability. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a cautious market environment where risk appetite is tempered.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of strong bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain some exposure due to potential for rebound but reduce slightly.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical pattern and mixed sentiment warrant a slight reduction in exposure, despite holding above key support.

SOL: +0.2 — Price increases and stable on-chain activity suggest moderate upside potential, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment; maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further declines in major cryptos, a slight increase in stablecoin exposure is prudent for risk management."
2024-08-15 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of slight recoveries and ongoing bearish signals. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, with recent news highlighting a sharp market dip and sideways futures trading, indicating uncertainty and limited conviction among traders. Ethereum is showing signs of potential bearish movement, with technical patterns suggesting possible further declines, although it remains above key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana has shown some positive price movement in recent hours. Tether faces regulatory risks, but its recent investment in a Kuwaiti fintech indicates ongoing expansion efforts. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets, favoring a balanced portfolio with some stablecoin exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and sideways trading indicate bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions suggest potential downside risk, justifying a slight reduction in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a lack of significant news, recent positive price movements and stable on-chain activity support a modest increase in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the regulatory risks, maintaining a moderate stablecoin position is advisable to hedge against broader market volatility."
