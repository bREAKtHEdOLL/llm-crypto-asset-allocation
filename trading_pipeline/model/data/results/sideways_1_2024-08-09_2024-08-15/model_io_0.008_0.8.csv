2024-08-09 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin experiencing a strong rebound, marking its largest single-day rally since February 2022. This surge has lifted the broader crypto market, with total market capitalization surpassing $2.1 trillion. However, Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, showing signs of weakness despite the market recovery. Solana has seen positive developments with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, indicating growing institutional interest, while Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and sharp value losses. Tether remains stable, with significant market activity as large amounts of USDT are moved to exchanges, suggesting increased trading activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by significant price increases and positive news, makes it an attractive asset for allocation. The market recovery and renewed trader confidence further bolster its appeal.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment in the news suggest caution. Its relative weakness compared to other assets warrants a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive news regarding the ETF launch and clarification on token supply concerns, combined with stable technical indicators, make it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's declining investor interest and negative news sentiment offset its technical indicators, resulting in a neutral allocation score.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery and increased risk appetite, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a strong recovery, surging nearly 12% and stabilizing above $61,500. This rebound has bolstered confidence across the crypto market, lifting total market capitalization above $2.1 trillion. However, Ethereum has underperformed, facing significant declines and negative sentiment, which contrasts with Bitcoin's strength. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest growing, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is experiencing waning investor interest and a decline in value, while Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution, suggesting a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news developments, such as the Solana ETF launch, support a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."
2024-08-09 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a significant recovery, rallying nearly 12% and stabilizing above $61,500. This rebound has bolstered market confidence, although Ethereum has underperformed, showing relative weakness amidst the broader crypto recovery. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest growing, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Meanwhile, Dogecoin continues to face challenges with declining investor interest. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's relative weakness and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive institutional developments and technical indicators support a moderate increase in allocation, reflecting growing confidence in Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite technical buy signals, declining investor interest and negative news sentiment suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-08-09 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, indicating renewed trader confidence. Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum is underperforming, which could be a cause for concern among investors. Solana is seeing positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, although there are concerns about token supply inflation. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest, while Tether is actively increasing its market presence, as evidenced by large transfers to exchanges and plans to expand its workforce.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive market sentiment, coupled with bullish technical indicators, suggest it is a good time to increase exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a cautious approach, keeping exposure neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the ETF launch in Brazil, along with generally bullish technical indicators, support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — With declining investor interest and negative news sentiment, it is prudent to reduce exposure slightly, although current holdings are zero.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-09 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery, showing strong upward momentum and renewed trader confidence. This is supported by a significant price rally, marking its strongest single-day performance since early 2022. Ethereum, however, is underperforming relative to other major assets, with analysts expressing concerns over its weak price action. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with institutional interest growing through the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, but concerns about token supply have been addressed by Binance. Dogecoin is facing a decline in investor interest, with sharp value losses and attention shifting to other meme coins. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong recovery and positive news sentiment, with technical indicators supporting continued upward momentum. Bitcoin's leadership in the market rebound makes it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment suggest a cautious approach. No current holdings to reduce, so a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest through the new ETF and clarification on token supply concerns provide a modest positive outlook, although recent price declines warrant some caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and sharp losses, Dogecoin lacks positive catalysts. No current holdings to reduce, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases with the broader market recovery, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a notable recovery, rebounding strongly after recent declines. This resurgence has bolstered trader confidence, lifting the broader crypto market. Ethereum, however, is underperforming, struggling to keep pace with the market recovery, which has raised concerns among analysts. Solana has seen mixed news, with institutional interest highlighted by a new ETF launch in Brazil, though technical indicators remain somewhat neutral. Dogecoin is experiencing declining interest and value, as attention shifts to other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether's increased activity on exchanges suggests heightened market engagement, though it remains a stable choice amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive momentum, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent news of a significant rally supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment in the news warrant a cautious approach. The lack of significant bullish signals keeps the score neutral.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's institutional interest, as evidenced by the new ETF, and the easing of supply concerns provide some positive sentiment, though technical indicators remain mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and negative news sentiment, Dogecoin lacks a compelling case for increased allocation, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — The market's increased risk appetite, as indicated by Bitcoin's recovery and the movement of USDT to exchanges, suggests a rotation out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-09 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum after a significant rally, which has helped lift the broader crypto market. Bitcoin's recovery has been supported by positive news, including its price stabilization above $61,500. However, Ethereum has underperformed relative to Bitcoin, facing bearish sentiment and skepticism about its price action. Solana has seen mixed signals, with concerns about token supply being addressed and positive news about a new ETF launch in Brazil. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest, with attention shifting to other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with increased activity as large amounts of USDT are moved to exchanges, indicating potential market shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong recovery and positive news support a bullish outlook. The upward momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest continued strength.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish technical indicators, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution. Lack of holdings also influences a conservative stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the ETF launch and resolution of supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop, despite mixed momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Declining investor interest and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest a neutral stance, especially with no current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin exposure and rotate capital into more volatile assets."
2024-08-09 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a strong recovery, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing after a recent dip. This rebound has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, showing signs of weakness compared to other major assets. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, while Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and value. Tether remains stable, with significant amounts being moved to exchanges, indicating increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with positive news and technical indicators, suggesting continued potential for gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news from the ETF launch support a favorable outlook, despite mixed technical signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and negative sentiment, Dogecoin lacks compelling reasons for allocation changes.

USDT: -0.3 — As the market shows signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to allocate more to growth assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-09 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a significant rebound, suggesting renewed trader confidence. Bitcoin's recent surge and stabilization around $61,500 indicate a positive momentum, although the broader market shows mixed signals. Ethereum is underperforming despite the broader crypto recovery, raising concerns about its relative weakness. Solana is experiencing increased institutional interest, evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, although technical indicators remain mixed. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and value, while Tether sees heightened market activity with large transfers to exchanges, indicating potential capital deployment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with significant price recovery and positive news sentiment, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment suggest a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF in Brazil support a moderate buy signal, despite mixed technical indicators.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and negative news sentiment, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — As market confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin increases, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-09 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, suggesting renewed trader confidence. However, Ethereum is underperforming, struggling with weak price action despite the broader crypto recovery. Solana is gaining institutional interest, evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, which could drive further adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest, with attention shifting to other meme coins. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity, possibly as traders prepare for increased volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment indicate a favorable environment for further gains. The buy signal from the trend indicators supports maintaining a bullish stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative news sentiment suggest caution. The lack of bullish momentum signals warrants a neutral position.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF launch in Brazil provide a bullish outlook. The asset's recent price stability and buy signals also support a positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — With declining investor interest and negative news sentiment, reducing exposure to Dogecoin is prudent, especially given its lack of bullish momentum.

USDT: -0.3 — As the market shows signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets like BTC and SOL is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-09 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since early 2022. This recovery has bolstered trader confidence and lifted the broader crypto market capitalization. However, Ethereum is underperforming, with analysts expressing concerns over its weak price action relative to other major assets. Solana has seen positive developments with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, indicating growing institutional interest, despite earlier concerns about token supply. Dogecoin is facing a decline in investor interest, with attention shifting to other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its workforce and has seen significant transfers to exchanges, suggesting increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment indicate a favorable environment for further gains. The buy signals from trend indicators support this view.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment suggest caution. Hold until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and the launch of a new ETF provide a positive backdrop for Solana, despite mixed technical indicators.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no strong technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current environment.

USDT: -0.3 — As the market shows signs of recovery, there is a slight preference for reallocating capital from stablecoins to more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-09 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since early 2022. This recovery is part of a broader market uplift, pushing the total crypto market capitalization above $2.1 trillion. However, Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, raising concerns among investors. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, although technical indicators remain mixed. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and value, while Tether is actively expanding its operations, indicating strong market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and the launch of a new ETF provide a positive outlook for Solana, though technical indicators remain mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive market sentiment and Bitcoin's strong performance, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recent recovery, rallying nearly 12% and stabilizing above $61,000. This rebound has bolstered trader confidence, although Ethereum has underperformed, experiencing significant declines and raising concerns about its relative weakness. Solana has seen mixed signals, with positive news from Binance addressing supply concerns and the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, indicating institutional interest. Dogecoin is facing a steep decline, with investor interest waning as attention shifts to other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its workforce and has seen significant inflows to exchanges, suggesting increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive market sentiment, along with supportive news, suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and the resolution of supply concerns provide a positive outlook for Solana, justifying a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral position on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — The increased market activity and capital rotation into riskier assets suggest reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-09 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery after a significant rally, while Ethereum and other altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing pressure. Bitcoin's recent surge has boosted market confidence, but Ethereum's underperformance and Dogecoin's decline suggest a cautious approach. Solana's news about the ETF launch in Brazil and Binance's clarification on supply concerns provide some positive sentiment, although the technical indicators remain weak. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a cautious risk environment, potentially favoring stablecoins like USDT for safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent strong rally and positive news support a moderate buy signal, although caution is warranted due to mixed technical indicators.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment, the lack of a strong technical sell signal suggests a hold position.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news from the ETF launch and Binance's clarification on supply concerns provide a slight buy signal, despite weak technicals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Continued decline and low activity suggest no change in allocation, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the overall mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, a slight preference for holding USDT as a safe haven is advisable."
2024-08-09 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since February 2022. This has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, facing criticism for its weak price action. Solana is gaining institutional interest, as evidenced by the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, despite concerns about token supply inflation. Dogecoin is struggling with declining investor interest, while Tether is seeing increased market activity with substantial transfers to exchanges, indicating potential capital deployment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent price increase and market recovery support a bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative news sentiment warrant a cautious stance. No current holdings justify a neutral score.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil are positive indicators. The asset's recent price stabilization supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no current holdings, Dogecoin remains unattractive for allocation. The lack of positive catalysts supports a neutral score.

USDT: -0.3 — The increased market activity and potential capital deployment suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings, as risk appetite may be increasing in the broader market."
2024-08-09 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news flow indicate a bullish sentiment, making it an attractive asset for allocation. 

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment suggest caution, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the ETF launch and clarification on supply concerns, along with a slight price recovery, support a modestly bullish outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the improved market sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets like BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery in the crypto space, evidenced by its recent 12% surge and stabilization near $61.5K. This rebound has lifted the broader market, although not all assets are participating equally. Ethereum is underperforming, with significant declines over the past week, raising concerns about its relative weakness. Solana has seen positive news with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, indicating growing institutional interest, despite some earlier concerns about token supply. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is facing declining investor interest and sharp value losses. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges suggesting heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news flow suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and ETF launch provide a positive backdrop, although technical indicators remain neutral, justifying a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and negative sentiment, Dogecoin does not present a compelling case for allocation at this time.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, there is a tendency to rotate out of stablecoins, though maintaining some exposure for stability is prudent."
2024-08-09 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong rebound, gaining nearly 12% amid a broader market recovery. This has lifted the total crypto market capitalization above $2.1 trillion, signaling renewed trader confidence. However, Ethereum is underperforming, with a significant drop over the week, raising concerns about its relative strength. Solana is experiencing positive institutional interest, evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, while Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and value losses. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges, indicating heightened market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive developments, such as the launch of a Solana ETF, support a moderately bullish outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no positive catalysts, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-09 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since early 2022. This has contributed to a broader market recovery, lifting the total crypto market capitalization. However, Ethereum is underperforming compared to other major assets, facing bearish sentiment despite the market's recovery. Solana is seeing positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, although concerns about token supply have been addressed. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and value losses, while Tether is experiencing heightened market activity with substantial transfers to exchanges, indicating increased trading activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent surge in on-chain activity supports this bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and clarification on supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, making it relatively attractive in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-08-09 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a notable recovery, surging nearly 12% and stabilizing above $61,500. This rebound has lifted broader market confidence, although Ethereum has underperformed, experiencing a 4% drop amid concerns about its relative weakness. Solana has seen positive developments, including the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, which may bolster institutional interest. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and value, while Tether remains active with significant transfers to exchanges, indicating heightened market activity and potential liquidity shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and increased market confidence suggest a favorable environment for further gains, supported by positive news and on-chain activity.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer bullish signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and the launch of a Solana ETF provide positive sentiment, coupled with stable on-chain activity, making it an attractive asset for incremental capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in the crypto market, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets like BTC and SOL is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-09 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong rebound and leading the broader crypto market recovery. Bitcoin's recent price surge and stabilization suggest renewed trader confidence, despite the lack of bullish technical signals. Ethereum, on the other hand, is underperforming, with weak price action and negative sentiment, as highlighted by its significant drop over the past week. Solana is gaining institutional interest, evidenced by the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, although technical indicators remain neutral. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest and value, facing competition from other meme coins. Tether is experiencing heightened market activity, with significant transfers to exchanges, indicating potential increased trading activity or liquidity needs.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite neutral technical indicators, Bitcoin's strong price rebound and positive market sentiment justify a moderately positive allocation score.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment offset any potential gains from broader market recovery, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and ETF launch in Brazil provide a positive outlook, though technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — Declining investor interest and lack of positive momentum suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-10 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the VIX at 20.48, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index at 103.14. The crypto market shows mixed signals; Bitcoin is holding steady after a recent rally, but momentum appears subdued. Ethereum is under pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, while Solana faces potential liquidation concerns due to a large whale transfer to Binance. Dogecoin remains quiet with no significant news, and Tether continues to expand its market cap, although it faces legal challenges with Celsius. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with a slight preference for stability and defensive positioning.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and stable price after a recent rally suggest a cautious buy, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell-off pressure and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a reduction in exposure, especially since it is not currently held in the portfolio.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is sensible for stability and liquidity."
2024-08-10 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing subdued momentum, particularly for BTC, which is consolidating after a recent rally. Ethereum faces selling pressure from market makers, while Solana sees potential liquidation activity from a large whale transfer. Dogecoin remains quiet with no significant news, and Tether continues to grow its market cap despite legal challenges. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a preference for stability and safety, as indicated by the strong performance of USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a lack of strong upward momentum, BTC's price stability and resilience in a consolidating range suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given the current market conditions.

ETH: 0.0 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a neutral stance, as the asset struggles to regain upward momentum.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious approach despite some bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or notable changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — In a cautious market environment, the preference for stability and safety supports a higher allocation to USDT, especially given its growing market cap and ongoing legal challenges."
2024-08-10 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 20.48. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin maintaining a stable range despite subdued momentum, while Ethereum faces selling pressure from major market-makers. Solana has seen significant whale activity, suggesting potential volatility, and Tether's market cap continues to grow, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times. Overall, the sentiment is cautious, with a preference for stability and liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC is holding steady within a range, supported by a consistent buy signal from short-term MAs. It remains a relatively stable asset in the current market.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent sell-offs by market-makers have created downward pressure, but without holding ETH, there's no immediate action required. The lack of bullish signals suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent to mitigate potential downside risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to alter exposure at this time.

USDT: +0.5 — With increased market cap and a stable price, USDT is attractive for maintaining liquidity in a cautious market environment. It serves as a hedge against volatility in other assets."
2024-08-10 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum and a recent price decline. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation, which could impact its price negatively. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news affecting its outlook. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst uncertain market conditions. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin's resilience and stable price action suggest a moderate buy signal, though subdued momentum tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent heavy sell-off by market makers creates uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange indicates potential selling pressure, justifying a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — The increase in Tether's market cap and current market uncertainty suggest a preference for maintaining liquidity and stability."
2024-08-10 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-08-10 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 20.48. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 103.14, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's market data reveals a mixed picture, with a recent surge in on-chain activity but subdued momentum and a lack of strong buy signals. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, while Solana's whale transfer suggests potential liquidation risks. Dogecoin shows no significant changes, and Tether's market cap milestone indicates continued demand for stablecoins amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite subdued momentum, the recent surge in on-chain activity and resilience in price suggest a cautious optimism. However, the overall market sentiment remains mixed, justifying a modest positive score.

ETH: 0.0 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals keep Ethereum in a neutral position. The absence of strong recovery indicators suggests holding off on increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential selling pressure. Given the lack of strong bullish signals, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, Dogecoin remains neutral. The absence of clear directional signals supports maintaining the current position.

USDT: +0.5 — The strong market cap growth and stable demand for USDT suggest a preference for maintaining liquidity in uncertain market conditions. This stablecoin remains attractive as a safe haven amid mixed sentiment in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward movements in prices for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. However, macroeconomic indicators such as a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility (VIX) suggest a mixed broader economic environment, which could influence crypto market stability. BTC has shown resilience despite subdued momentum, while ETH faces pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs. SOL and DOGE are experiencing positive momentum signals, although SOL's whale transfer to an exchange could indicate potential selling pressure. USDT remains stable, with its market cap reaching a new high, reflecting its continued demand as a safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — BTC shows resilience with a slight upward price trend, but the lack of strong momentum signals and subdued market sentiment suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, ETH faces significant sell-off pressure from market-makers, and the absence of strong bullish signals warrants a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — SOL shows bullish momentum, but the large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, suggesting a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — DOGE has shown bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, but the lack of significant news keeps the allocation modestly positive.

USDT: -0.2 — With a high market cap and stable price, USDT remains a safe haven, but slight capital rotation into riskier assets is suggested by the overall market sentiment."
2024-08-10 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum, maintaining its range after a recent rally. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dampened its price performance. Solana has seen notable whale activity, indicating potential distribution, which could lead to increased volatility. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news impacting its market. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, reflecting its continued demand as a stablecoin, although it faces legal challenges with Celsius.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin's price stability and resilience suggest a moderate buy signal, supported by increased on-chain activity, despite the lack of strong momentum signals.

ETH: -0.3 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of positive momentum signals suggest caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure if held.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the whale transfer indicating potential volatility, Solana's bullish momentum and normal activity levels suggest holding the current position without changes.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current position in Dogecoin is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the legal uncertainties and the current market's cautious optimism, maintaining a moderate level of USDT for stability and potential reallocation opportunities is prudent."
2024-08-10 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment exhibits a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin remains resilient, trading within a stable range despite subdued momentum. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, although technical indicators suggest potential bullish momentum. Solana shows signs of potential distribution or liquidation, indicated by a large whale transfer to Binance. Dogecoin has no significant news but maintains bullish momentum. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, but ongoing legal disputes could introduce uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is stable with a buy signal from the short-term moving average, supported by strong on-chain activity. However, the lack of significant bullish news tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent sell-offs, technical indicators show bullish momentum. The potential for a rebound exists, but caution is warranted given recent price pressure.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure. While technicals remain bullish, this news introduces some risk.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish technical indicators and increased on-chain activity support a positive outlook, although the absence of significant news limits confidence.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-10 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a stable U.S. dollar index, with the S&P 500 showing strength. In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is maintaining a stable price range despite subdued market momentum, while Ethereum is facing selling pressure from major market-makers. Solana has seen significant whale activity, potentially indicating upcoming volatility. Dogecoin shows bullish momentum but lacks significant news to drive further movement. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, highlighting its role as a stable asset amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin is holding steady within its range, with on-chain activity indicating normal engagement. Given the stable macro environment, a slight increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent heavy sell-off by market-makers suggests caution. Reducing exposure is prudent until the selling pressure subsides.

SOL: +0.1 — While technical indicators are positive, the whale transfer to Binance suggests potential volatility. A cautious increase in allocation is justified, but with close monitoring.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity support a modest increase in allocation, though the absence of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market sentiment leaning towards stability and potential risk-on behavior, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly in favor of riskier assets is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of stabilization after recent fluctuations. Bitcoin is holding steady despite subdued market momentum, indicating resilience in its current trading range. Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dampened its price. Solana experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation, which could impact its price negatively. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether's market cap has reached a new high, reflecting its ongoing demand as a stablecoin amidst legal disputes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's resilience and steady trading range, coupled with a consistent buy signal from trend indicators, suggest a moderate preference for maintaining or slightly increasing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of significant positive news create a bearish sentiment, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious approach to Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current position in Dogecoin is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against market fluctuations."
2024-08-10 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight upward price movements and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is holding steady despite recent volatility, indicating resilience, though momentum remains subdued. Ethereum faces sell-off pressures from market makers, which has significantly impacted its price. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to Binance, suggesting potential distribution or liquidation, which may weigh on its price. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains a positive technical outlook. Tether's market cap continues to grow, reflecting its role as a stable liquidity anchor amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows resilience with a consistent buy signal from trend indicators, though momentum is subdued. Its stability makes it relatively attractive in the current market.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the heavy sell-off from market makers and recent price decline suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent.

SOL: +0.2 — While technical indicators are positive, the large whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential selling pressure. Maintain a modest positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — With no significant news but positive technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a neutral to slightly positive asset in the portfolio.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains a neutral holding. Its growing market cap suggests continued demand for stability, balancing risk exposure in the portfolio."
2024-08-10 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is holding steady despite recent volatility, but lacks strong momentum, as indicated by subdued trading activity and a recent decline. Ethereum is under pressure from significant sell-offs by major market makers, contributing to a bearish outlook. Solana faces potential downward pressure due to a large whale transfer to an exchange, which could signal impending liquidation. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its market. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap has reached a new high, but it faces legal challenges that could affect its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a buy signal from trend indicators, Bitcoin lacks momentum and is trading within a range, suggesting a neutral stance is appropriate.

ETH: -0.5 — The significant sell-off by market makers and the resulting price pressure warrant reducing exposure to Ethereum, given the bearish sentiment.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, making it prudent to slightly reduce exposure to Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral position on Dogecoin is advisable.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and Tether's increasing market cap, a slight increase in stablecoin exposure provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-10 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight price increases and positive short-term technical indicators. Bitcoin remains resilient, trading within a stable range despite subdued momentum. Ethereum faces pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs, which has impacted its price negatively. Solana has experienced a large whale transfer to Binance, suggesting potential selling pressure. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its price. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin shows resilience with stable trading patterns and positive short-term trend signals, but the lack of strong momentum suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — The heavy market-maker sell-off and recent price pressure warrant a slight reduction in exposure, despite positive technical signals.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to an exchange indicates potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious approach despite positive technical indicators.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.1 — The high market cap and legal disputes suggest a stable demand for USDT, warranting a slight increase in allocation as a hedge against market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context is characterized by moderate volatility and stable interest rates, with a notable increase in gold prices, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows resilience despite subdued momentum, maintaining its position within a stable range. Ethereum faces significant sell-off pressure from market makers, impacting its price negatively. Solana experiences potential liquidation signals from large whale transfers, which could indicate upcoming volatility. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether's market cap growth reflects its continued demand as a stable asset amidst market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and stable on-chain activity support a modest positive outlook, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent heavy sell-offs by market makers and downward price pressure suggest caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — The whale transfer to an exchange signals potential volatility, but without further confirmation, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainties and the increase in USDT's market cap, a slight preference for holding stablecoins is justified to manage risk."
2024-08-10 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum, and Ethereum facing pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs. Solana's large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential liquidation, which could weigh on its price. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a stable position, while Tether's market cap milestone reflects its growing role as a liquidity anchor amidst legal challenges. The macroeconomic context indicates a stable environment with moderate volatility, as reflected in the VIX, and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and buy signals from trend indicators suggest a moderate positive outlook. The lack of significant negative news supports maintaining a slight preference for BTC.

ETH: -0.3 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish momentum indicate potential downside risk, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, but the absence of other negative signals keeps the score slightly negative.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in the current environment.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market conditions and legal uncertainties surrounding Tether, maintaining a slightly positive score reflects a cautious approach to liquidity management."
2024-08-10 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mix of cautious optimism and underlying volatility. Bitcoin is experiencing a period of consolidation with subdued momentum, indicating a stable but non-aggressive market sentiment. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down, suggesting caution. Solana's recent whale transfer to Binance indicates potential liquidation, which could imply bearish sentiment. Dogecoin is showing signs of bullish momentum, possibly due to technical factors rather than news-driven events. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, reflecting its role as a stable store of value amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While BTC is stable and consolidating, the lack of strong momentum and mixed news suggests a cautious but slightly positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent heavy sell-offs and lack of positive news create a bearish sentiment, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to Binance hints at potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious stance despite no immediate negative price action.

DOGE: +0.5 — Technical indicators show bullish momentum, and the absence of negative news supports a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and Tether's increasing market cap, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for risk management."
2024-08-10 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic with some mixed signals. Bitcoin is showing resilience despite subdued market momentum and a recent decline, indicating a stable trading environment. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down significantly. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation or distribution, which could impact its price.

Tether continues to grow its market cap, reflecting its strong position as a stablecoin, although it's dealing with legal issues involving Celsius.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, Bitcoin's resilience and stable trading range suggest a slight preference for maintaining exposure, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.3 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and recent price decline warrant caution, suggesting a reduction in exposure to manage risk.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious stance despite no immediate negative price impact.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and lack of negative news provide a favorable environment for Dogecoin, suggesting an increased allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed signals across the market, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a safe haven amidst uncertainty."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience and maintaining its position after a recent rally, despite subdued momentum. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has led to a notable price decline. Solana faces potential downward pressure from a large whale transfer to an exchange, possibly indicating liquidation. Dogecoin is experiencing bullish momentum with no significant news affecting its trajectory. Tether continues to grow in market cap, reflecting its role as a stable asset amid market fluctuations. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, though the high gold price indicates some investor caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows resilience and bullish momentum, with strong on-chain activity supporting a positive outlook. However, the overall subdued market momentum tempers the score.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-offs by market makers and a lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The recent price decline further supports a reduced allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, despite some bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and positive technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook, though the absence of significant news keeps the score moderate.

USDT: +0.2 — With mixed signals across other assets and a stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a hedge against potential volatility."
2024-08-10 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum, while Ethereum faces pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs. Solana's large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential liquidation, which could impact its price negatively. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news, and Tether's market cap continues to grow, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amid market uncertainties. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility, with the S&P 500 and gold prices indicating a cautious risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows resilience with a recent buy signal and bullish momentum, suggesting potential for moderate gains despite subdued market momentum.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum faces downward pressure from large sell-offs, lacking strong bullish signals, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to Binance indicates potential selling pressure, despite some bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite low activity, Dogecoin's consistent buy signals and bullish momentum suggest a moderate opportunity for gains.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market conditions and Ethereum's sell-off, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-10 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience and maintaining its price level despite subdued momentum. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to Binance, potentially indicating a sell-off, but it continues to exhibit bullish momentum in its technical indicators. Dogecoin is experiencing bullish momentum with no significant news impacting its price. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, reflecting its continued demand as a stablecoin amidst legal disputes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing resilience and maintaining its price level, supported by bullish technical indicators. The overall market sentiment remains positive, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum is under pressure from heavy sell-offs by market makers, resulting in a lack of bullish signals. This suggests reducing exposure to ETH in the short term.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a large whale transfer to Binance, SOL maintains bullish momentum in its technical indicators, indicating potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin is experiencing bullish momentum with no significant news impacting its price, suggesting a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of resilience and potential bullish momentum, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-10 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin exhibits strong technical indicators and on-chain activity, suggesting continued upward momentum and resilience in the current market environment.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under pressure from substantial sell-offs, and technical indicators do not support a bullish outlook, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, but the overall market activity remains stable, leading to a slightly negative outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral, warranting a hold position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential volatility in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against market fluctuations."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite a recent decline, maintaining a steady position after a rally. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has impacted its price negatively. Solana experienced a notable whale transfer to Binance, which could indicate potential selling pressure. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news impacting its market position. Tether continues to grow its market cap, reaching an all-time high, but faces legal challenges with Celsius. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, suggest a cautious market environment, with investors potentially seeking stability in assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the subdued market momentum, BTC's technical indicators remain positive, with buy signals from trend and momentum indicators. Its resilience in maintaining price levels supports a modest positive allocation.

ETH: -0.5 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to Binance indicates potential selling pressure, and while technical indicators are positive, the news suggests caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral with no strong directional bias.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for increased volatility, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides a safety net, especially with its growing market cap."
2024-08-11 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals, particularly BTC and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing consistent buy signals with bullish momentum, indicating potential upward movement, though no significant news is impacting its price. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, is facing resistance and bearish momentum, suggesting caution. Solana is maintaining a positive trend with bullish momentum, but lacks significant news catalysts. Dogecoin is experiencing a potential breakout, driven by speculative sentiment and discussions about its long-term potential. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance and utility in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, resistance and bearish momentum suggest caution, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with stable on-chain activity, support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential breakout, driven by speculative interest, make it appealing for increased exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-11 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum signals. Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a strong technical position with consistent buy signals and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a potential for further gains. Ethereum (ETH) has seen a significant rally but faces resistance, indicating potential consolidation or a pullback. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) both exhibit bullish momentum, with DOGE experiencing a notable price breakout driven by speculative interest. Tether (USDT) remains a stable choice, with its market cap milestone and new developments on the Lightning Network reinforcing its dominance as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals and increased on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent rally, resistance and mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a hold.

SOL: +0.6 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum make SOL a favorable asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The recent price breakout and speculative interest provide a moderate buy signal, though caution is advised due to its hype-driven nature.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals across other assets, there's a rationale for reducing stablecoin exposure to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-11 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment displays a generally bullish sentiment across most cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Solana, and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum supported by positive technical indicators. Ethereum has experienced a significant rally but is facing resistance, indicating potential caution. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest, driven by hype cycles, while Tether continues to solidify its position as the leading stablecoin with new developments. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, potentially favoring risk-on assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Consistent bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential, making BTC attractive in the current environment.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite a recent rally, ETH faces resistance and mixed signals, warranting a cautious approach given the potential for a pullback.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and steady on-chain activity support a favorable outlook for SOL, aligning with the broader bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and strong momentum indicate potential for further gains, though the hype-driven nature suggests a measured approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market leaning towards risk-on assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-11 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators, such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, which all exhibit buy signals from short-term moving averages and positive momentum signals. However, macroeconomic conditions, such as a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility in the S&P 500, suggest a mixed backdrop for risk assets. Ethereum's recent rally to resistance levels and Dogecoin's speculative hype cycles highlight potential volatility. Meanwhile, Tether's milestone in market capitalization and its expansion to the Bitcoin Lightning Network underscore its growing importance as a stablecoin, suggesting a solid foundation for liquidity and risk management in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of significant news, BTC shows strong technical indicators with buy signals and bullish momentum, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum are tempered by resistance levels, indicating a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a moderate allocation increase, despite the absence of significant news.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE shows bullish technical indicators, its price remains driven by speculative hype, warranting a neutral stance given the potential for volatility.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-11 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with most assets exhibiting positive momentum and trend signals. Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain strong technical indicators, although Ethereum has faced some resistance at higher levels. Solana continues to show consistent on-chain activity and positive momentum, while Dogecoin is experiencing speculative interest but remains volatile. Tether's market cap milestone and integration into the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing utility and dominance in the stablecoin market. Overall, the macroeconomic context is stable, with moderate volatility and no significant disruptions, allowing for a cautiously optimistic outlook on risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite no significant news, BTC shows strong technical indicators and on-chain activity, suggesting continued bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — While ETH has faced resistance, its overall upward trend and recent rally support a positive outlook, albeit with some caution due to potential resistance.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent on-chain activity and positive technical signals suggest a favorable environment for SOL, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative interest is high, but the lack of substantial news or technical breakthroughs suggests a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — With a bullish sentiment in the market, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to increase exposure to other risk assets."
2024-08-11 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with most assets experiencing upward momentum in both price and technical indicators. Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit strong buy signals, supported by positive trend and momentum indicators. Ethereum's recent rally, despite facing resistance, indicates bullish sentiment, while Solana and Dogecoin also show positive momentum. Tether's market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance, though it remains a stable asset in a risk-on environment.

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with a consistent buy signal, supported by bullish momentum. The absence of significant news keeps the focus on technicals.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite hitting resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum suggest continued interest. The potential for further gains remains, albeit with caution due to resistance levels.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana maintains a positive trend and momentum, with no significant news to disrupt its current trajectory. The technical indicators support a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's price is driven by hype, and while it shows positive momentum, the speculative nature warrants a cautious approach. The potential for hype-driven spikes suggests a slight increase.

USDT: -0.3 — In a risk-on environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, despite its growing market cap and technological developments."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight upward price movements and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's price has been gradually increasing, supported by bullish momentum signals, although on-chain activity remains low. Ethereum has experienced a significant rally, but it faces resistance at higher levels, suggesting potential volatility. Solana and Dogecoin are both exhibiting bullish momentum, with Solana showing signs of a breakout. Dogecoin's price is influenced by speculative sentiment, as discussions about its potential to reach $1 continue. Tether's stablecoin, USDT, maintains a strong market position, reaching a new market cap milestone and expanding its utility with the launch of USDT-L on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Given the current macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, the market is positioned for cautious risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's price is showing consistent upward momentum, supported by technical indicators, but low on-chain activity suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's strong rally and bullish momentum warrant a moderate positive allocation, though caution is advised due to potential volatility.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price breakout and sustained bullish momentum make it an attractive option for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — While speculative interest is high, Dogecoin's price movements are largely driven by hype, suggesting a cautious positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive sentiment in the broader crypto market, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-08-11 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and slight price increases over the past few hours. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing upward momentum, supported by strong buy signals and increased on-chain activity for BTC. Ethereum's recent rally has faced resistance, suggesting potential short-term consolidation. Solana and Dogecoin also exhibit bullish momentum, with DOGE driven by speculative interest. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing utility and dominance in the stablecoin sector. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, potentially supporting continued interest in risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and increased on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum. The absence of significant news keeps the focus on technicals.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and breakout potential warrant a positive outlook, albeit with caution due to recent resistance.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a favorable outlook, with no significant news altering sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, the speculative nature and lack of substantial news keep the allocation neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-11 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain positive technical indicators, with Ethereum experiencing a notable rally, although it faces resistance at higher levels. Solana and Dogecoin also exhibit bullish momentum, supported by technical signals. However, Dogecoin's price remains speculative, driven by hype rather than fundamentals. Tether's recent milestone in market capitalization and its launch on the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance in the crypto ecosystem, suggesting a stable demand for USDT amidst market volatility. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, does not indicate any immediate risk-off sentiment, allowing for cautious optimism in crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows consistent buy signals across trend and momentum indicators, with increased on-chain activity suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and strong technical indicators warrant a positive outlook, though tempered by the recent resistance level.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana maintains bullish momentum with normal on-chain activity, indicating steady interest and potential for continued upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, the speculative nature of Dogecoin's recent commentary suggests caution, keeping the allocation neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing a slight bullish bias, there is a moderate preference to rotate some capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, despite USDT's strong market position."
2024-08-11 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 20.6. The crypto market is experiencing bullish signals across most assets, with short-term moving averages above long-term ones and positive momentum indicators. Ethereum has shown a significant rally but faces resistance, while Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype. Tether's market cap milestone and its launch on the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing prominence. The overall sentiment leans towards cautious optimism, with potential for further gains if resistance levels are overcome.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decline in recent hours, BTC maintains a bullish trend and positive momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity. However, the absence of significant news keeps the score moderate.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum are tempered by resistance at current levels. The potential for further gains exists, but caution is warranted due to the recent price surge.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana continues to show bullish momentum and consistent on-chain activity. The lack of significant news keeps the score moderate, but the technical indicators are supportive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative interest and slight price increases, Dogecoin's fundamentals remain unchanged. The hype-driven nature of its price movement warrants a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT, despite its recent market cap milestone and innovations."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility with a VIX of 20.6, and stable U.S. dollar strength as indicated by the DXY at 103.14. The cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals, with most assets experiencing slight price declines over the past hours despite overall bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing strong buy signals from trend and momentum indicators, although Bitcoin's recent price drop below the lower Bollinger Band suggests potential short-term bearish pressure. Ethereum has recently rallied but faces resistance, indicating potential consolidation. Solana and Dogecoin maintain bullish technicals but have seen slight price decreases. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance and utility in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price decline, BTC maintains bullish trend and momentum signals. However, the breakdown below the Bollinger Band warrants cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent rally and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for further gains, but resistance levels should be monitored.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a modestly bullish outlook, despite slight price declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE has bullish technical indicators, its price remains driven by speculative sentiment, and recent declines suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, despite its strong market position and recent developments."
2024-08-11 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin has experienced a slight downtrend in the past hours, with a breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential bearish pressure. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, is facing resistance and signs of bearish momentum. Solana and Dogecoin are also showing bearish signals with price breakdowns, although Dogecoin's sentiment is buoyed by speculative discussions about its potential to reach $1. Tether's market cap milestone and the launch of USDT on the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance as a stablecoin, suggesting a cautious market sentiment with a preference for stability amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a buy signal from trend indicators, the breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band and lack of significant news suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent rally faces resistance, and bearish momentum is emerging. Slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

SOL: -0.2 — Price breakdown and lack of supportive news indicate a need to reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative discussions provide some support, but technical indicators are mixed. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — With increased volatility and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent for stability."
2024-08-11 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable U.S. economy with moderate interest rates and a strong dollar index, which can exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 is performing well, indicating a generally positive sentiment in traditional markets, but the elevated VIX suggests some underlying volatility concerns. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing a technical breakdown with low on-chain activity, while Ethereum shows signs of resistance after a recent rally. Solana and Dogecoin are facing bearish momentum despite buy signals from short-term moving averages. Tether's market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance and utility in the stablecoin sector.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a technical breakdown with low on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious approach is warranted. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity indicate a potential for recovery. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana is experiencing a technical breakdown with no significant news to drive sentiment. Maintaining current exposure is prudent until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype, and current technical indicators do not support a strong buy. A slight reduction in exposure is advised to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market volatility and Bitcoin's technical breakdown, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-11 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility with the VIX at 20.6, and stable interest rates and crude oil prices. The U.S. Dollar Index is relatively strong, which might exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The market data over the past hours indicates a general bearish sentiment across most cryptocurrencies, with BTC, SOL, and DOGE showing consistent price declines and technical indicators not signaling strong bullish momentum. ETH has shown some resilience with a recent rally, but it faces resistance and bearish momentum. USDT remains strong, with a notable market cap milestone and new developments on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, suggesting a preference for stability amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is experiencing a price breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band with no bullish momentum signals. Given the current bearish market sentiment, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent resistance, ETH's previous rally and bullish momentum signal provide some optimism. However, caution is warranted due to potential bearish momentum.

SOL: -0.4 — SOL is showing significant price declines and technical indicators suggest a breakdown, warranting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite speculative interest, DOGE is experiencing significant price decreases with no bullish momentum, suggesting a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.7 — With the current bearish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies and USDT's strong market cap milestone, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and stability."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment reflects a mixed sentiment with moderate volatility (VIX at 20.6) and stable U.S. dollar strength (DXY at 103.14). The crypto market is experiencing a general downturn, with most assets showing price decreases over the past hours. Bitcoin and Solana are facing potential breakdowns, indicated by their positions below the lower Bollinger Bands. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, is encountering resistance and bearish momentum. Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype, while Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakdown with low on-chain activity and no bullish momentum. Maintaining a cautious stance due to current holdings.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's previous rally and consistent on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. Slightly positive outlook given current market conditions.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana is experiencing significant price decreases and lacks bullish signals, indicating a potential need to reduce exposure due to current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price remains speculative with no strong data or news-driven catalysts. Maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT for stability and to capitalize on its growing market cap and integration developments."
2024-08-11 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin and Solana experiencing price breakdowns below their Bollinger Bands, indicating potential bearish pressure. Ethereum has shown a recent rally but is facing resistance, while Dogecoin's price remains speculative, driven by hype cycles. Tether's market cap milestone and its launch on the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance as a stablecoin. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable U.S. dollar, suggests a mixed risk environment, where cautious capital allocation may be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is experiencing a breakdown below its Bollinger Bands with low on-chain activity, suggesting potential further downside. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is warranted.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and consistent on-chain activity provide a modestly positive outlook, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's persistent breakdown below Bollinger Bands and lack of significant news or bullish signals suggest a cautious stance, warranting a slight reduction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price remains speculative with no significant changes in data or sentiment, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: +0.3 — In a mixed market environment with some bearish signals, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, especially given its recent market cap milestone."
2024-08-11 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 20.6. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin and Solana are experiencing technical weakness, with both assets trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Ethereum has shown a recent rally but faces resistance, and its technical indicators do not currently support a strong bullish case. Dogecoin is driven by speculative interest, but lacks substantial technical or fundamental support. Tether's stablecoin dominance is reinforced by its market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, suggesting a strong demand for stablecoins in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest weakness, with no significant news to drive a bullish case. Maintaining a cautious stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent price gains, Ethereum faces resistance and lacks strong bullish momentum. Holding current positions seems prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's technical breakdown and lack of supportive news suggest reducing exposure slightly, though maintaining some position for potential rebounds.

DOGE: 0.0 — Driven by hype cycles, Dogecoin lacks strong technical or fundamental support. No change in allocation is warranted.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and Tether's strong market position, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity option."
2024-08-11 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the macroeconomic context and recent market data. The U.S. Dollar Index is relatively strong, and the VIX suggests moderate volatility, which may lead to cautious trading behavior. Bitcoin and Solana are showing signs of potential breakdowns, while Ethereum has recently rallied but faces resistance. Dogecoin's price remains speculative, driven by hype cycles.

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin shows no bullish signals and is experiencing low on-chain activity, indicating potential weakness. The lack of significant news further supports a cautious stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum faces resistance and bearish momentum, suggesting a neutral position until clearer signals emerge.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with a moderate U.S. Dollar Index and a slightly elevated volatility index (VIX), suggesting some market caution. The recent market data indicates a bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE experiencing significant price decreases in the last hour and showing no strong buy signals from technical indicators. On the other hand, USDT is exhibiting bullish momentum, supported by its recent milestone of reaching a $115 billion market cap and its expansion into the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This suggests a preference for stability and liquidity, reflecting a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC has shown a significant price drop and lacks bullish technical signals, indicating a cautious stance is warranted. No significant news supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite a recent rally, ETH is facing resistance and bearish momentum, suggesting a potential for further downside. The absence of strong buy signals supports a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.4 — SOL is experiencing a price breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band, with no positive news or technical indicators to support a buy. Reducing exposure is prudent.

DOGE: -0.5 — DOGE's price breakdown and reliance on speculative hype cycles, without substantial bullish news or technical support, suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — With bullish momentum and positive news regarding its market cap and technological advancements, USDT remains a preferred asset for stability in the current bearish environment."
2024-08-11 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a bearish sentiment, as evidenced by significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Technical indicators show no buy signals, with momentum indicators also pointing downward. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility, suggests risk aversion, which typically benefits stablecoins like USDT. The news highlights for ETH and DOGE indicate speculative interest but also resistance and hype-driven cycles, respectively. USDT's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network further solidify its position as a stable store of value in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Significant price decline and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite recent rally news, the technicals are weak, and the market faces resistance, indicating a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.4 — Similar to BTC and ETH, SOL shows bearish technicals and significant price drops, warranting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Driven by speculative hype with no strong technical support, reducing exposure is prudent given the bearish market.

USDT: +0.8 — In a risk-averse environment, USDT's stability and recent developments make it an attractive asset to increase exposure."
2024-08-11 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price decreases observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Technical indicators show no strong buy signals, with most assets trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential breakdowns. On-chain activity for BTC indicates a surge in transactions, which could imply heightened interest or panic selling. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with bullish technical indicators and a recent milestone in market capitalization, suggesting a preference for stability amidst market volatility. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable gold prices, further supports a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, BTC's technical indicators remain weak, and the market sentiment is bearish. Holding a moderate position is prudent.

ETH: -0.2 — Recent price resistance and bearish momentum suggest caution. The lack of significant news and technical support warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — SOL's price continues to decline with no positive technical signals. Maintaining a cautious stance is advisable given the bearish trend.

DOGE: -0.4 — DOGE's price is driven by hype cycles, and current technical indicators are negative. Reducing exposure is recommended in the absence of strong fundamentals.

USDT: +0.8 — With bearish conditions across other assets, USDT's stability and recent market cap milestone make it an attractive safe haven. Increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to mitigate risk."
2024-08-11 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price decreases observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past hours. Technical indicators are showing no buy signals, and momentum indicators remain below their signal lines, suggesting continued downward pressure. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, further supports a cautious approach. In contrast, USDT has achieved a market cap milestone and remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of market uncertainty. The lack of significant positive news for most assets, except for Ethereum's recent rally and Tether's developments, suggests limited immediate upside potential.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Persistent bearish technical signals and lack of positive news suggest reducing exposure to manage downside risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, ETH faces resistance and bearish momentum, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — With no significant news and technical indicators showing bearish trends, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: -0.1 — Speculative sentiment remains, but technical weakness and low activity suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish conditions and USDT's stability, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital."
2024-08-12 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with BTC and ETH experiencing notable declines in price and outflows from investment vehicles such as ETFs. Bitcoin's price is under pressure due to significant outflows, while Ethereum faces potential sell-offs indicated by large whale movements. Solana shows some technical resilience, bouncing off key moving averages, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, DOGE remains relatively quiet with no significant news, and USDT continues to be a safe haven amid market volatility, despite legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price drop and ETF outflows suggest a bearish outlook. However, Marathon Digital's investment plans provide a slight buffer, warranting a moderate reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off by a whale and the recent price dip below key support levels indicate bearish momentum, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the broader market downturn, Solana's bounce off the 200-day EMA indicates technical strength, making it relatively more attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining or slightly increasing USDT exposure is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-08-12 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant declines in both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, influenced by ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders. Bitcoin is experiencing a notable dip, with outflows from ETFs and a general market downturn contributing to its decline. Ethereum is also under pressure, with large transfers to exchanges suggesting potential sell-offs, and technical indicators pointing to fading bullish momentum. Solana, however, shows some resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential technical strength. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news, while Tether maintains its stability amidst legal challenges and partnerships aimed at expanding blockchain education.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite Marathon Digital's plans to increase holdings, the current ETF outflows and price decline suggest caution. The bearish sentiment and technical indicators do not support an increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.5 — The potential sell-off by a whale and the recent price dip below key support levels indicate a need to reduce exposure. The bearish momentum is strong, and further declines are possible.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's bounce off the 200-day EMA suggests some technical strength, making it relatively more attractive in the current market environment. However, caution is warranted due to overall market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no strong reason to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market sentiment and potential further declines in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce risk."
2024-08-12 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, which have experienced outflows and sell-offs. Bitcoin is facing pressure from ETF outflows, while Ethereum is under potential sell pressure from a whale movement. Despite these challenges, Solana shows signs of technical strength after bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with no major shifts in indicators like the U.S. Dollar Index or S&P 500, but the elevated VIX suggests increased market volatility. In such conditions, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a slight risk-off approach is prudent, favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings, the overall sentiment is bearish due to ETF outflows and price declines. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off from a whale and recent price drop below $2,600 suggest further downside risk. A cautious approach is warranted by reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — The technical rebound off the 200-day EMA indicates potential bullish momentum, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current position is advisable.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies and increased market volatility, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-08-12 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with BTC facing ETF outflows and ETH seeing potential sell-off signals from whale activity. Despite these setbacks, Solana shows signs of technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, which could indicate renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable amidst legal challenges, reinforcing its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions. The macroeconomic environment, with elevated volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution, though Marathon Digital's expansion plans offer some longer-term support.

ETH: -0.4 — Bearish sentiment from whale movements and recent price drops indicate potential further downside, warranting reduced exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical rebound from the 200-day EMA suggests potential for upward movement, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish signals in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin experienced significant outflows from ETFs, indicating potential profit-taking or reduced institutional interest. Ethereum faces selling pressure from a large whale, suggesting possible further declines. Solana shows technical resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, which might attract bullish interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk appetite, though the elevated gold price indicates some flight to safety. Tether remains stable despite legal challenges, underscoring its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — ETF outflows and recent price declines suggest caution. Maintain some exposure but reduce slightly due to bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.4 — Significant whale activity and price drop indicate potential for further downside. Reduce exposure to manage risk.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical strength from the 200-day EMA bounce suggests potential for recovery. Increase exposure modestly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals keeps DOGE neutral. Maintain current position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, increase exposure to USDT for stability and capital preservation."
2024-08-12 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced significant declines, with Bitcoin seeing a 4.8% drop amid ETF outflows and Ethereum falling 5.7% as bearish momentum builds. News of Marathon Digital's plan to raise funds for more Bitcoin purchases could provide some support, but the immediate sentiment remains negative. Solana shows some technical strength after bouncing off its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is maintaining its stability despite legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution, but Marathon Digital's plans may offer future support. Current sentiment is slightly bearish.

ETH: -0.4 — Significant sell-off and potential whale sell pressure indicate bearish sentiment, with support around $2,500 being tested.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical rebound off the 200-day EMA suggests potential bullish sentiment, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and risk management."
2024-08-12 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant price declines over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has seen a notable outflow from ETFs, indicating reduced institutional interest, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from a large whale movement. Solana shows some technical strength by bouncing off its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether maintains its stability despite legal challenges and continues to focus on educational initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest bearish sentiment, though Marathon Digital's plans to increase holdings provide some support.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off from a whale and recent price drop below $2,600 indicate bearish momentum, with support around $2,500 being tested.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical rebound off the 200-day EMA suggests potential bullish sentiment, making it relatively more attractive in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price movement suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signals for allocation changes.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, especially as other assets show declining trends."
2024-08-12 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with recent declines in BTC and ETH prices amid broader market corrections and ETF outflows.

Ethereum faces potential sell-offs from a significant whale, adding to bearish pressures as it approaches key support levels.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings provide a supportive backdrop, suggesting potential for a rebound.

ETH: -0.2 — The potential sell-off from a whale and recent price declines highlight bearish pressures, warranting caution as it approaches support levels.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength from bouncing off the 200-day EMA and recent price increases suggest renewed bullish momentum, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increases indicate some positive momentum, but the lack of significant news keeps the signal modest.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintaining a neutral stance on USDT, as market conditions do not strongly favor a shift towards or away from stablecoins at this time."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin seeing significant outflows from ETFs and Ethereum facing potential sell-offs from large holders. Despite these challenges, Solana shows signs of technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, which could indicate a potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not affecting its stability. The macroeconomic context, with a high VIX and stable USD index, suggests a risk-averse environment, favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent ETF outflows and price declines suggest caution. While Marathon Digital's plans to buy more BTC could be positive, the immediate sentiment is bearish.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off signals from whale movements and recent price declines indicate a bearish outlook. Support around $2,500 is a critical level to watch.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical rebound off the 200-day EMA shows potential bullish sentiment, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price movements suggest a neutral stance. No clear signals to adjust allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the risk-averse macro environment and recent declines in major cryptos, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability."
2024-08-12 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, partly due to ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders, respectively. Despite this, Solana shows signs of technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, which suggests potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, but its recent price movements indicate some bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not impacting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent ETF outflows and a lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The market sentiment is slightly bearish, warranting a reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.2 — Potential sell-off by a large holder and bearish momentum indicators suggest a cautious approach. The price is nearing important support levels, indicating potential further downside.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength from rebounding off the 200-day EMA and sustained bullish momentum suggest increased allocation to capitalize on potential upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, recent bullish momentum and price increases suggest a modest increase in exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further downside in major assets, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-12 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum despite recent price dips. Bitcoin has experienced a slight recovery after a notable decline, supported by Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings, which may bolster confidence. Ethereum faces potential selling pressure from a large whale movement, but it remains above critical support levels. Solana demonstrates technical strength, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin shows positive momentum without significant news, while Tether remains stable amidst legal challenges and partnerships aimed at enhancing blockchain education.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's investment plans and a recovery in price suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for BTC.

ETH: -0.3 — Potential sell-off signals from whale movements and recent price dips suggest caution, although it remains above key support levels.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical rebound and positive momentum signal a favorable environment for SOL, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive price momentum and lack of negative news provide a mild bullish signal, though no major catalysts are present.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-12 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant upward price movements observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE in the past few hours. Despite recent declines, technical indicators for ETH and SOL suggest potential bullish breakouts, while BTC's on-chain activity remains robust despite ETF outflows. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with no drastic changes in key indicators such as interest rates or the U.S. dollar index. However, the elevated VIX suggests potential volatility, which may influence short-term trading strategies. News highlights include Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings and Ethereum's potential sell-off by a whale, which could impact short-term price dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows, BTC shows strong upward momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — While there is a risk of a sell-off due to whale activity, the recent price breakout and bullish technical indicators warrant a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical rebound and bullish momentum signal a favorable outlook, making SOL an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive price momentum and technical indicators suggest a slight increase in allocation, although no significant news supports a stronger move.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-12 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a dip, influenced by significant ETF outflows, although Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings could provide some support. Ethereum is facing potential sell pressure from a whale movement, with technical indicators suggesting a bearish outlook. Solana shows technical resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains bullish momentum technically. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal issues not impacting its market position. Overall, the macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and a stable dollar index, suggests a cautious approach with a preference for maintaining liquidity in USDT while selectively increasing exposure to assets showing technical strength.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Recent ETF outflows and price dip suggest caution, despite Marathon Digital's bullish plans. Maintain a slightly reduced exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Potential sell-off from whale activity and technical indicators pointing to bearish momentum warrant a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength from the 200-day EMA bounce and bullish momentum justify increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technicals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed market signals and potential volatility, maintaining a higher liquidity position in USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by significant sell-offs and ETF outflows. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, with recent news of Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings potentially providing some support. Ethereum faces bearish pressure with large whale movements suggesting potential sell-offs, although technical indicators still show some bullish momentum. Solana shows technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news, while Tether continues to maintain its stability despite legal challenges and is actively engaging in educational initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite Marathon Digital's plans to increase holdings, the recent ETF outflows and price decline suggest caution. The market sentiment is bearish, and reducing exposure may be prudent.

ETH: -0.2 — The potential sell-off by a whale and the recent price drop below $2,600 indicate bearish sentiment. However, the ongoing bullish momentum in technical indicators suggests only a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rebound off its 200-day EMA and the positive technical signals suggest a potential bullish trend, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintaining the current position without changes is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and recent declines in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT could provide stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-12 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent dips. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant price increases in the last hour, indicating a potential rebound. However, there are concerns about ETF outflows for Bitcoin and potential sell-offs for Ethereum, which could introduce volatility. Solana shows technical strength, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, suggesting renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin has no significant news but follows the general market trend of recovery. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal disputes not affecting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin's recent price surge and Marathon Digital's plans to increase holdings suggest positive momentum. The overall market recovery supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's price recovery and on-chain activity are positive, but potential sell-off risks from whale movements warrant caution. The technical outlook remains mixed, justifying a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bounce off the 200-day EMA and consistent bullish momentum indicate strong technical resilience, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — While lacking significant news, Dogecoin's price increase and bullish technical indicators align with the broader market recovery, supporting a slight buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there's a potential rotation out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, suggesting a reduction in exposure."
2024-08-12 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of volatility and cautious optimism. Bitcoin has experienced a slight dip, influenced by ETF outflows, but remains buoyed by news of Marathon Digital's plans to increase its holdings. Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from a whale movement and has seen a notable price decline, with bearish sentiment eyeing support at $2,500. Solana shows technical resilience, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, suggesting renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains a positive technical outlook. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not impacting its market position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, BTC's long-term potential is supported by Marathon's expansion plans, indicating confidence from institutional players.

ETH: -0.3 — The potential sell-off from a significant whale and recent price decline suggest caution, with bearish sentiment prevailing in the short term.

SOL: +0.6 — Technical strength and a rebound from key support levels signal a positive outlook, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall market sentiment and potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted."
2024-08-12 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by broader market declines and notable outflows from BTC ETFs. Despite this, there are pockets of bullish momentum, particularly in technical indicators for assets like SOL, which has shown resilience by bouncing off its 200-day EMA. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable amid ongoing legal challenges, with no significant impact on its stability reported. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high VIX, suggests increased market volatility, which may favor a cautious approach with a tilt towards stable assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the significant price drop and ETF outflows suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.2 — The potential for a sell-off indicated by whale activity and the recent price dip warrant a cautious stance. Reduce exposure slightly.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical strength shown by rebounding off the 200-day EMA supports a moderate increase in allocation, despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintain current holdings without changes.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, a slight increase in stablecoin holdings is prudent to hedge against further declines in other assets."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum despite recent price declines. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant price drops, influenced by ETF outflows and potential large-scale sell-offs, respectively. However, technical indicators for both assets remain bullish, suggesting potential for recovery. Solana shows technical strength, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains a positive technical outlook. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not affecting its market stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with potential sell-off pressure from large holders and bearish news. Technical indicators remain bullish, but sentiment is cautious.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical rebound from the 200-day EMA and consistent on-chain activity suggest a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — No significant news, but technical indicators remain bullish. Minor positive adjustment due to overall market sentiment.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-12 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, influenced by ETF outflows and broader market declines. Ethereum is also under pressure, with potential sell-offs indicated by whale movements and a drop in price. Despite this, Solana shows some technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, suggesting a potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its market position. Tether remains steady amidst legal challenges, maintaining its stability as a safe haven in volatile conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite technical buy signals, the recent price decline and ETF outflows suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off by a whale and recent price drop indicate bearish sentiment. Reduce exposure to mitigate downside risk.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical strength from rebounding off the 200-day EMA suggests potential for upward movement. Increase exposure modestly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price action suggest maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, increase exposure to USDT as a safe haven to preserve capital."
2024-08-12 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, influenced by broader market conditions and specific news events. Bitcoin is experiencing outflows from ETFs, which may indicate reduced institutional interest, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from significant whale movements. Solana shows technical strength, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, and Tether maintains its stability despite legal challenges. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable gold and oil prices, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical signals, ETF outflows and recent price declines suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off signals from whale activity and recent price drops below key support levels warrant a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical rebound from the 200-day EMA indicates potential bullish momentum, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for further declines in major cryptocurrencies, a slight increase in stablecoin holdings is advisable for risk management."
2024-08-12 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by significant outflows and potential sell-offs. Bitcoin's price has been pressured by ETF outflows, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from a whale movement. Despite these bearish signals, technical indicators for BTC and ETH remain bullish, suggesting potential for recovery. Solana shows signs of technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether continues to maintain stability amidst legal challenges and partnerships aimed at fostering blockchain education.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, technical indicators remain bullish, and Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings provide a positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — The potential sell-off by a whale and recent price drop below $2,600 suggest caution, though technical indicators are still bullish.

SOL: +0.6 — The rebound from the 200-day EMA and bullish technical indicators suggest strong potential for upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the potential for recovery in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."
2024-08-12 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin seeing significant ETF outflows and Ethereum facing potential sell-offs from large holders. Despite these challenges, both assets maintain some bullish technical signals. Solana shows technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news, while Tether is focused on maintaining stability amidst legal challenges and expanding educational initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.2 — The potential for a sell-off by large holders and recent price declines suggest caution, though technicals still show some bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength and a rebound from the 200-day EMA indicate a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent, but the potential for recovery in other assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and slight price increases over the past few hours. However, macroeconomic conditions, such as a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggest a mixed environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced recent declines, influenced by ETF outflows and potential whale sell-offs, respectively. Solana shows technical strength after bouncing off its 200-day EMA, while Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains bullish momentum. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal disputes not affecting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows and a price dip, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain bullish. However, cautious optimism is warranted given the macroeconomic backdrop.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from a whale movement and recent price declines. While technicals are still positive, the risk of further downside warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rebound from its 200-day EMA and consistent technical signals suggest renewed bullish sentiment, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — With no significant news but maintaining bullish momentum, Dogecoin remains a modestly attractive option in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-12 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum despite recent dips. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable price declines, influenced by ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders, respectively. However, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain strong, and there is institutional interest in increasing BTC holdings. Ethereum faces bearish pressure but maintains key support levels. Solana shows technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains upward momentum. Tether remains stable amid legal challenges, with no immediate impact on its price stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, strong technical indicators and institutional interest suggest potential for recovery. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: -0.2 — Recent sell-off pressure and whale activity suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly while monitoring support levels.

SOL: +0.6 — Technical rebound and positive momentum signal potential for further gains. Increase exposure to capitalize on bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Maintains upward momentum without significant news. Slightly increase exposure due to positive technical signals.

USDT: -0.3 — With improving risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, reduce stablecoin holdings to allocate capital to more promising opportunities."
2024-08-13 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and modest price increases. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing upward momentum despite warnings of potential sell-offs and significant on-chain activity related to the Mt. Gox payout. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking asset, with new benchmarks being introduced, indicating growing institutional interest. Solana (SOL) has shown notable gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks significant news but maintains a bullish technical stance. Tether (USDT) has seen a substantial outflow from exchanges, suggesting a potential risk-off environment, which could signal caution in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite potential sell-off warnings, BTC shows strong technical indicators and momentum. However, caution is advised due to the Mt. Gox news.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from growing staking interest and new benchmarks. Strong technical indicators support a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.4 — Leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index with positive momentum signals, suggesting a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish technical indicators with slight price increases, though lacking significant news. A cautious buy signal is warranted.

USDT: 0.0 — Significant outflows suggest reduced selling pressure on BTC, but potential risk-off signals warrant maintaining current holdings without further allocation."
2024-08-13 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing upward momentum, but there are concerns about potential sell pressure, particularly with the Mt. Gox payout looming. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking alternative, which could enhance its appeal to institutional investors. Solana (SOL) is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has no significant news but maintains bullish technical signals. Tether (USDT) is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, which may signal a risk-off sentiment and potential BTC downtrends.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite strong upward momentum, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox payouts and analyst warnings temper enthusiasm. Maintain a cautious positive stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong buy signals and increasing institutional interest in staking make ETH attractive. The introduction of a new staking benchmark further supports this view.

SOL: +0.2 — Modest gains and positive momentum suggest a slight increase in allocation, but lack of strong buy signals limits enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, the absence of significant news or developments suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges and reduced selling pressure on BTC suggest a shift away from stablecoins as risk appetite increases."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.12. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which can exert pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows bullish momentum with consistent buy signals, but faces potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox distribution news. Ethereum continues to gain traction with institutional interest in staking, providing a stable outlook. Solana is performing well, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin has no significant news to drive sentiment. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, which could impact Bitcoin negatively.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox distribution warrants caution. Maintain a slight positive bias due to overall market strength.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional interest in staking and positive technical indicators support a favorable outlook. ETH remains attractive as a ""risk-free"" yield alternative.

SOL: +0.6 — Leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index and positive momentum signals make SOL an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators. Maintain a neutral stance given the lack of clear directional signals.

USDT: -0.3 — Large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential shift towards risk assets, but maintain some exposure due to potential market volatility."
2024-08-13 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH. Despite bullish technical indicators, such as buy signals from moving averages and MACD, the market is experiencing downward pressure, particularly highlighted by the potential for a significant BTC price drop as noted by analysts. The news of the Mt. Gox payout adds uncertainty to BTC's short-term outlook. Ethereum's staking developments suggest growing institutional interest, but recent price declines indicate caution. Solana shows relative strength with modest gains, while DOGE lacks significant news. The substantial outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a risk-off sentiment, potentially signaling further downside for BTC and other risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite technical buy signals, the potential for a significant price drop and Mt. Gox-related uncertainty warrant caution.

ETH: 0.0 — Institutional interest in staking is positive, but recent price declines and mixed market sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Relative strength in price and positive news within the CoinDesk-20 index make SOL slightly more attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — The outflow of USDT from exchanges and potential risk-off sentiment support holding more stablecoins for safety."
2024-08-13 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to potential sell pressure on Bitcoin and significant outflows of USDT from exchanges, which often precede BTC downtrends. Bitcoin's technical indicators remain bullish, but news of potential sell-offs and Mt. Gox payouts could introduce volatility. Ethereum shows strong staking activity, positioning it as a stable asset amidst market uncertainty. Solana is leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating relative strength. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. The large USDT outflow suggests a risk-off sentiment, with investors potentially seeking safer assets or preparing for market downturns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential for a $5K drop due to sell pressure and Mt. Gox payouts introduces significant downside risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking activity and the introduction of a new staking benchmark support Ethereum's role as a stable asset, appealing in uncertain market conditions.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive price movement and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest relative strength, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite outflows, maintaining a higher USDT allocation can provide stability and liquidity in a potentially volatile market environment."
2024-08-13 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish technical indicators and some bearish news. Bitcoin shows strong technical momentum, but there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings of a possible price drop. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could enhance its appeal as a stable yield-generating asset. Solana has shown modest gains, indicating some positive momentum. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining its status quo. Tether's large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, which could signal caution in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite strong technical indicators, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox and analyst warnings temper enthusiasm. Maintain a cautious buy stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive developments in staking as a benchmark and strong technical signals support a moderate buy signal, despite recent price decreases.

SOL: +0.4 — Modest gains and bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate reduced selling pressure on BTC and a potential shift towards riskier assets, suggesting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong performance in the S&P 500. In the crypto market, BTC shows bullish momentum and significant on-chain activity, but there are concerns about potential sell pressure and distribution from the Mt. Gox wallet. ETH is experiencing increased interest in staking, which is viewed as a stable yield alternative, although its price momentum is less clear. SOL has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk‑20 index, suggesting positive sentiment. DOGE lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. USDT has seen a large outflow from exchanges, which could indicate a risk-off sentiment and potential BTC downtrends.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox and analyst warnings suggest caution. A moderate positive score reflects the mixed signals.

ETH: +0.2 — The growing interest in staking as a benchmark rate is positive, but the lack of clear price momentum tempers enthusiasm. A slight positive score reflects the potential for stability and growth in the staking sector.

SOL: +0.5 — Leading the CoinDesk‑20 index with modest gains indicates positive sentiment and potential for further growth. A higher score reflects the asset's relative strength in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of clear directional signals suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, warranting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets with growth potential."
2024-08-13 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing significant sell pressure, potentially leading to a $5K decline, compounded by the Mt. Gox payout, which could introduce additional volatility. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, suggesting institutional interest, though its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana shows modest gains and leads the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating relative strength. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a risk-off sentiment, potentially signaling a bearish outlook for Bitcoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technicals, the looming Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings of a potential $5K drop suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.2 — Institutional interest in staking and the introduction of a new staking benchmark provide a positive outlook, though technicals are neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Leading the CoinDesk-20 index with positive price momentum and volume, indicating potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a potential risk-off environment, warranting a slight increase in stablecoin holdings for capital preservation."
2024-08-13 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout anticipation, which could lead to a significant price drop. Ethereum's staking narrative is gaining traction, positioning it as a potential ""risk-free"" yield alternative, although its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana shows modest gains and leads in the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating some positive momentum. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a stable position. Meanwhile, the significant outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly leading to increased BTC accumulation but also signaling caution in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the potential sell pressure from the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings suggest caution. Holding but reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with no strong bullish momentum and neutral technical indicators. The staking narrative is positive but not enough to warrant increased exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index provide a positive outlook. Maintaining a slightly increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators. Maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite the outflow from exchanges, the potential for increased BTC accumulation suggests holding a stable position in USDT for risk management."
2024-08-13 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals. Bitcoin is facing potential downward pressure due to significant sell signals and concerns about a large Mt. Gox payout, which could increase supply in the market. Ethereum is seeing increased interest in staking, which might support its price stability, but technical indicators remain neutral. Solana has shown some resilience with modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and its technical indicators are neutral. Tether's substantial outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating a shift towards holding more stable assets like USDT in anticipation of market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Concerns over potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox payouts and bearish news suggest reducing exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — While staking interest is positive, technical indicators are neutral, warranting a hold position.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate a slight preference for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges and potential market volatility support increasing stablecoin holdings for risk management."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as stable interest rates and moderate volatility. Bitcoin faces potential downward pressure due to sell-side dominance and the looming Mt. Gox distribution, which could introduce significant supply into the market. Ethereum's staking developments provide a positive long-term outlook, although short-term technicals remain neutral. Solana shows relative strength with modest gains, while Dogecoin lacks significant catalysts. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a risk-off sentiment, potentially signaling reduced liquidity and increased volatility in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Concerns over potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox distributions and bearish analyst predictions suggest caution.

ETH: +0.1 — While technicals are neutral, the growing institutional interest in staking provides a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.3 — Relative strength in price and positive news support a modestly bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the potential for increased volatility and bearish sentiment in BTC, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent."
2024-08-13 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the macroeconomic context and recent news. The U.S. dollar index remains strong, and the volatility index is moderate, suggesting a stable yet uncertain economic environment. Bitcoin faces potential downward pressure due to sell dominance and the Mt. Gox payout, which could increase supply. Ethereum's staking developments provide a positive long-term outlook, but short-term technical indicators are neutral. Solana shows some positive momentum, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum. Tether's large outflow from exchanges signals a potential risk-off sentiment, suggesting a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The potential for a $5K drop and the Mt. Gox payout create downside risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite neutral short-term technicals, the positive developments in staking provide a slight bullish sentiment for long-term positioning.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's modest gains and positive momentum in the CoinDesk-20 index make it relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position without changes.

USDT: +0.6 — With increased risk-off sentiment and large outflows from exchanges, maintaining or increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven in uncertain conditions."
2024-08-13 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.12. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin faces potential downward pressure due to sell dominance and the impending Mt. Gox payout, which could increase BTC supply. Ethereum is seeing increased interest in staking, positioning it as a potential ""risk-free"" rate alternative. Solana is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news. Tether's large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating a cautious stance among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The potential for a significant price drop due to sell pressure and the Mt. Gox payout creates a bearish outlook. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Increased interest in staking and the introduction of a new staking benchmark provide a supportive backdrop. However, technical signals remain neutral, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest a favorable environment for Solana. The bullish trend signals support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral. Current holdings should be maintained without adjustment.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite the large outflow from exchanges, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT can provide a buffer against potential market downturns, especially given the bearish signals for BTC."
2024-08-13 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward price movements observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. However, BTC faces potential downside risks due to increased sell pressure and the impending Mt. Gox distribution, which could introduce significant volatility. Ethereum's staking yield is gaining traction as a benchmark rate, suggesting growing institutional interest. Solana shows modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating some positive momentum. Meanwhile, DOGE lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. USDT's large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, with investors possibly preparing for a downturn in BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases, significant sell pressure and the potential impact of the Mt. Gox distribution warrant caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Growing institutional interest in staking and stable price movements suggest moderate confidence in ETH's potential.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price momentum and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate a favorable outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — Large outflows from exchanges suggest a cautious market stance, favoring holding stablecoins amid potential volatility."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing slight upward price movements and bullish momentum signals, particularly in SOL and BTC. However, there are underlying concerns, such as potential sell pressure on BTC due to the Mt. Gox payout and significant USDT outflows from exchanges, which could signal a risk-off sentiment. Ethereum's staking developments are gaining traction, indicating growing institutional interest. The macroeconomic environment is stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases and bullish momentum, the potential sell pressure from the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings of a possible $5K drop warrant caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Institutional interest in staking and the introduction of a new staking benchmark provide a positive outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong bullish momentum and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining the current position.

USDT: +0.1 — While significant outflows suggest a risk-off sentiment, the stablecoin's role as a safe haven in uncertain times justifies a slight positive bias."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC), which faces potential downward pressure due to anticipated sell-offs and significant outflows from stablecoins like USDT. Ethereum (ETH) shows promising developments in staking, which could bolster its appeal as a ""risk-free"" rate alternative, though its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana (SOL) is exhibiting positive momentum and has been leading gains in the broader market index. Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks significant news or movement, maintaining a neutral stance. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable indices, suggests a cautious approach, with a potential preference for stablecoins amid uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the potential for a significant sell-off and outflows from stablecoins suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the bearish news.

ETH: +0.2 — While technicals are neutral, the positive developments in staking and institutional interest provide a slight bullish tilt. Maintaining a modest allocation is advisable.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical signals and leading performance in the market index justify an increased allocation. The asset shows resilience and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate. The asset does not currently warrant increased or decreased exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — While there are signals of reduced selling pressure on BTC, the overall market uncertainty and potential risk-off sentiment justify a slight preference for holding stablecoins."
2024-08-13 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant price increases observed in BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past hour. BTC and SOL have shown strong upward momentum, breaking above their respective Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakouts. However, macroeconomic indicators such as the U.S. Dollar Index and Treasury yields remain stable, suggesting no immediate external pressures. News about potential BTC sell-offs due to Mt. Gox payouts and USDT outflows from exchanges could signal caution, but the overall market is showing resilience with increased activity and positive momentum in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox payouts, BTC's strong price momentum and on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential. However, caution is warranted due to the risk of a sudden downturn.

ETH: +0.3 — ETH shows significant price increases and growing institutional interest in staking, which supports its attractiveness. However, technical indicators remain mixed, suggesting a moderate allocation increase.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL's consistent buy signals and strong price momentum, coupled with positive news and its leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index, make it a favorable asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE experienced a price increase, the lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining the current position without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — The large outflow of USDT from exchanges and reduced selling pressure on BTC indicate a shift towards riskier assets, suggesting a reduction in USDT holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-13 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish momentum observed in BTC, ETH, and SOL, while DOGE remains relatively stable without significant news. BTC shows signs of potential downward pressure due to news of possible sell-offs and the Mt. Gox payout, which could introduce volatility. ETH is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, indicating growing institutional interest. SOL is leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, reflecting positive sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, with reduced selling pressure on BTC but also signaling caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum, news of potential sell-offs and the Mt. Gox payout introduce downside risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest in staking and positive momentum support a modest increase in allocation, despite neutral technical signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong bullish momentum and leading performance in the broader index suggest a favorable environment for increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators warrant a neutral stance, maintaining current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite outflows, the potential for increased volatility in BTC suggests maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin reserve for risk management."
2024-08-13 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish momentum observed in assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL, as indicated by their technical indicators and recent price movements. However, macroeconomic indicators such as the U.S. Dollar Index and volatility index suggest a cautious approach, with potential risks on the horizon. News of potential BTC sell pressure from the Mt. Gox payout and significant USDT outflows from exchanges indicate a possible risk-off environment, which could lead to increased volatility and downward pressure on BTC. Meanwhile, Ethereum's growing staking rate is gaining traction as a benchmark, which could bolster its appeal as a stable investment. Solana shows resilience with modest gains, while DOGE remains largely unchanged due to a lack of significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox and macroeconomic caution warrant a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive developments in staking and technical indicators suggest moderate upside potential, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical signals and recent gains position SOL as a favorable asset, with potential for continued positive performance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the potential for increased market volatility and risk-off sentiment, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against downside risks."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by technical indicators and increased on-chain activity, although there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could enhance its appeal as a yield-generating asset. Solana (SOL) is showing modest gains and leading the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating positive sentiment. Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether (USDT) is seeing large outflows from exchanges, which could signal a risk-off sentiment, but also suggests reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox payouts, BTC's strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Growing acceptance of ETH staking as a benchmark rate and positive momentum indicators support a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate a positive sentiment, though not as strong as BTC or ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-13 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical signals despite some recent price declines. Bitcoin is experiencing significant on-chain activity and bullish momentum, but there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to news of Mt. Gox BTC distributions and analyst warnings. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could enhance its appeal as a ""risk-free"" yield alternative. Solana is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news. There is a notable outflow of USDT from exchanges, which could signal a shift towards risk-off sentiment, potentially impacting Bitcoin negatively.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bullish momentum and on-chain activity, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox distributions and analyst warnings tempers enthusiasm. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional interest in staking and the introduction of a new staking benchmark make ETH attractive. Positive technical signals support a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's modest gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index, combined with bullish technical indicators, justify a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.2 — The large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential shift towards risk-off sentiment, but given the current portfolio's substantial USDT holdings, a slight reduction is prudent to rebalance towards more active assets."
2024-08-13 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and buy signals from short-term moving averages. Despite some short-term price fluctuations, the technical indicators suggest a general upward trend. Bitcoin faces potential downward pressure due to recent news about the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings, but on-chain activity remains robust. Ethereum's staking metrics are gaining traction as a benchmark, adding a layer of stability and attractiveness to the asset. Solana is leading the CoinDesk-20 index with modest gains, indicating strong relative performance. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating reduced selling pressure on Bitcoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the potential for a short-term drop due to Mt. Gox news, BTC's technical indicators remain bullish, and on-chain activity is strong, warranting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's growing staking metrics and bullish technical indicators make it an attractive asset, with potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong performance in the CoinDesk-20 index and consistent bullish signals suggest it is well-positioned for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.4 — The large outflows from exchanges and potential risk-off sentiment suggest reallocating some capital away from stablecoins to capitalize on bullish trends in other assets."
2024-08-13 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with technical indicators showing bullish momentum across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. However, there are mixed signals from the macroeconomic context and news. The U.S. Dollar Index is relatively stable, and the S&P 500 is high, suggesting a risk-on environment, but the VIX is moderately elevated, indicating some underlying market volatility. Bitcoin faces potential downward pressure due to sell signals and the Mt. Gox distribution news, which could increase supply. Ethereum's staking developments are positive, enhancing its attractiveness as a ""risk-free"" yield alternative. Solana shows modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains bullish technical signals. Tether's large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating reduced selling pressure on BTC but also signaling caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite bullish technicals, the potential for a $5K drop and Mt. Gox distribution news introduce significant downside risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive developments in staking as a benchmark rate enhance ETH's appeal, supported by strong technical indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest continued interest, supported by bullish technicals.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in sentiment, but technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Large outflows from exchanges suggest caution, but maintaining some USDT exposure is prudent given potential market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators such as short-term moving averages above long-term ones and positive momentum signals. However, macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggest a mixed environment for risk assets. Bitcoin faces potential downside risks due to sell pressure and upcoming Mt. Gox distributions, while Ethereum's staking developments are gaining traction as a benchmark rate. Solana shows modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, and Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news. Tether's large outflows from exchanges could signal a risk-off sentiment, potentially indicating a shift towards holding more stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox distributions and analyst warnings of a $5K drop necessitate caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong staking developments and institutional interest provide a positive outlook, supported by bullish technical indicators.

SOL: +0.6 — Leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index and consistent bullish momentum suggest continued strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, there is no clear signal to adjust the current position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the potential risk-off sentiment indicated by large outflows from exchanges, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to stablecoins is prudent."
2024-08-14 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin's recent ETF-related news and miner activity suggest institutional confidence and potential price stabilization. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply is a concern, but upcoming technical upgrades could bolster its long-term outlook. Solana's network activity is at record highs, hinting at robust ecosystem growth, although price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining its status quo. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and increased minting on Ethereum indicate shifting liquidity dynamics, potentially signaling a move towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and miner activity suggest a strong foundation for upward momentum, making BTC attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite inflationary concerns, upcoming technical upgrades and consistent bullish momentum support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential performance upgrades make SOL appealing, though price uncertainty warrants cautious optimism.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-14 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH showing bullish technical indicators and institutional interest, particularly in Bitcoin. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk appetite. Bitcoin's recent ETF-related news and miner activity suggest potential for upward movement. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming network upgrades present a mixed outlook. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows and minting activities indicate shifts in liquidity, reflecting a dynamic stablecoin environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and positive technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook. Miner activity hints at a potential price bottom, supporting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the inflationary supply shift, upcoming network upgrades and continued bullish momentum provide a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout make Solana attractive, though mixed sentiment warrants caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets is advisable."
2024-08-14 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment for major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, supported by strong institutional interest and technical indicators. Bitcoin's potential bottoming event and institutional investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs suggest increased confidence and potential for upward movement. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply is a concern, but upcoming technical upgrades may counterbalance this. Solana's network activity is at record levels, indicating strong usage, though price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether's large outflows from exchanges and increased minting suggest shifting liquidity dynamics, possibly indicating a move towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive institutional news and strong technical indicators suggest potential for further gains. The miner capitulation could signal a price bottom, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite inflationary concerns, upcoming technical upgrades and strong technical indicators provide a moderate bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout support a positive stance, though mixed sentiment warrants caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges and increased minting indicate a potential shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-14 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest in Bitcoin as evidenced by significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks. This suggests growing confidence in Bitcoin's long-term prospects. Ethereum, while experiencing a shift toward inflationary supply, is undergoing technical upgrades that could enhance its smart contract functionality. Solana's network activity is robust, with potential for a breakout, though sentiment remains mixed. Dogecoin lacks significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable position. Tether's substantial outflows from exchanges and new minting on Ethereum suggest shifting liquidity dynamics, possibly indicating a move towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and positive momentum signals suggest strong confidence and potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift toward inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades provide a positive outlook, warranting modest allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — High on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout justify a positive allocation, despite mixed sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without adjustments.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and significant outflows from exchanges, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-08-14 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with bullish signals for Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by institutional interest and technical upgrades, respectively. Bitcoin's potential bottoming event and increased ETF investments suggest a positive outlook. Ethereum's shift to an inflationary supply is a concern but is balanced by upcoming technical improvements. Solana's network activity is strong, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin shows no significant news or changes, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges indicate a shift in liquidity, but its minting on Ethereum suggests continued demand and liquidity provision.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and potential bottoming event provide a bullish outlook, supported by positive technical indicators.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the shift toward inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades and positive momentum signals support a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.3 — High on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout justify a cautious but positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges and increased risk appetite suggest a reduction in stablecoin holdings, favoring allocation to other assets."
2024-08-14 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's market is buoyed by institutional interest, as evidenced by significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks, suggesting growing confidence. Ethereum's transition to an inflationary supply could weigh on its price, despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana shows strong on-chain activity, indicating potential for growth, though price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether's large outflows from exchanges and subsequent minting on Ethereum highlight liquidity shifts and potential risk aversion.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and miner activity suggest strong support and potential for price appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming Pectra fork with developer-friendly upgrades provides a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential performance boosts from the Firedancer upgrade support a bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges and increased market liquidity indicate a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-14 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows signs of institutional interest with significant investments in spot ETFs, though miner outflows suggest potential price bottoming. Ethereum is experiencing a shift toward inflationary supply, which may dampen its attractiveness despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana's network activity is robust, indicating strong usage, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum, while Tether has seen large outflows from exchanges, indicating a potential shift in liquidity preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and potential price bottoming due to miner activity provide a bullish outlook, despite mixed momentum signals.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's shift to inflationary supply is a concern, the upcoming Pectra fork and consistent bullish momentum signals support a moderate positive stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and potential performance upgrades provide a positive outlook, though price direction remains uncertain.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical momentum keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest a rotation out of stablecoins, indicating a moderate reduction in USDT holdings as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-14 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with the S&P 500 at a high level and the VIX indicating low volatility, suggesting a relatively calm market atmosphere. Bitcoin's institutional adoption is gaining traction with major banks increasing their ETF positions, signaling confidence in BTC's long-term potential. Ethereum is experiencing a shift toward inflationary supply, which may weigh on its price. Solana's on-chain activity is surging, indicating strong network usage, though its price direction remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Tether's significant outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity preferences, possibly indicating a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and miner activity suggest a potential bottoming event, making BTC attractive for capital allocation despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum faces inflationary pressures, the upcoming Pectra fork and strong technical signals provide a moderate buy opportunity.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential performance upgrades make SOL appealing, despite the lack of a clear technical buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall positive sentiment towards riskier assets like BTC and SOL, reducing USDT exposure slightly aligns with a modest risk-on approach."
2024-08-14 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of institutional interest through significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks. This, coupled with miner capitulation, suggests a potential bottoming event for Bitcoin. Ethereum is experiencing a shift towards inflationary supply, which may dampen its appeal slightly, but upcoming technical upgrades could provide future support. Solana is seeing record on-chain activity, hinting at strong network fundamentals, although price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent large outflows from exchanges and subsequent minting on Ethereum indicate liquidity shifts, possibly reflecting changing investor risk appetites.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investments and miner capitulation suggest a strong foundation for potential price recovery, making Bitcoin a preferred asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades and consistent bullish momentum support a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout make Solana an attractive asset, though with some caution due to mixed sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.4 — The large outflows from exchanges suggest a decrease in demand for stablecoins as investors may be seeking higher-risk assets, warranting a reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-14 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility in the S&P 500 and a steady U.S. Dollar Index. The crypto market exhibits mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential institutional interest through increased ETF investments, suggesting a possible bottoming event. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades may influence its price dynamics. Solana is experiencing significant on-chain activity, indicating strong network usage and potential for price movement. Meanwhile, Tether's large outflows from exchanges and new minting suggest shifts in liquidity preferences. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement in select assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest through ETF investments and miner capitulation suggest a potential price bottom, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite inflationary supply concerns, the upcoming technical upgrades and sustained bullish momentum support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and technical indicators suggest potential for upward movement, supported by recent price breakout signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-08-14 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and steady S&P 500 performance, suggesting a neutral risk appetite. However, recent market data indicates a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant price drops in the last hour, despite positive institutional news for Bitcoin and technical upgrades for Ethereum. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or bullish signals. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and new minting on Ethereum suggest shifts in liquidity and potential increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price drop, institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest potential for a price bottom and recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's recent shift to inflationary supply is a concern, the upcoming Pectra fork and technical developments provide a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout make Solana an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical signals suggest a neutral stance for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — With large outflows from exchanges and increased market liquidity, there is a slight preference to rotate capital into more volatile assets."
2024-08-14 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing institutional interest with significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting growing confidence, but recent miner capitulation indicates potential bottoming. Ethereum is transitioning to an inflationary supply, which may dampen bullish sentiment despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana is seeing record on-chain activity, which could support a bullish breakout, but the price remains near key support levels, creating uncertainty. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether has seen large outflows from exchanges, indicating a shift in liquidity preferences, but recent minting suggests continued demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and potential bottoming signals provide a moderately positive outlook, despite recent price declines.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply concerns balanced by upcoming technical upgrades and a stable price trend.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout make Solana relatively attractive in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding current positions without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Although there are large outflows from exchanges, the recent minting indicates ongoing demand, warranting a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure as risk appetite may increase."
2024-08-14 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed backdrop with relatively stable interest rates and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows potential institutional interest with major banks increasing their ETF positions, although miner capitulation suggests caution. Ethereum's shift to an inflationary supply could weigh on its price, but upcoming technical upgrades may provide longer-term support. Solana's network activity is robust, hinting at potential upside, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity preferences, although recent minting indicates continued demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest a potential price bottom, providing a moderately positive outlook despite recent price weakness.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply pressures balanced by upcoming technical upgrades; maintaining a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout position Solana favorably, supported by technical indicators and network upgrades.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical signals suggest a hold position, with no clear catalyst for movement.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate a shift away from stablecoins, suggesting a moderate reduction in USDT holdings as risk appetite increases."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and stable interest rates, with the S&P 500 showing strength. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest with major banks increasing their positions in Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting growing confidence. However, miner capitulation indicates potential short-term price pressure. Ethereum's transition to an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades present mixed signals. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, indicating strong network usage, though price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest through ETF investments and miner capitulation suggest a potential price bottom, warranting a moderate buy signal despite recent price declines.

ETH: 0.0 — The shift to inflationary supply and lack of strong bullish signals in technicals suggest a neutral stance, awaiting further clarity from upcoming network upgrades.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout provide a positive outlook, making it an attractive allocation in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, maintain a neutral position as there is no clear direction.

USDT: -0.3 — The large outflows from exchanges indicate a potential decrease in demand for stablecoins, suggesting a slight reduction in USDT holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-14 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing institutional interest with significant investments in spot ETFs, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential despite recent miner capitulation indicating possible price bottoming. Ethereum is facing a shift towards inflationary supply, which could weigh on its price, though upcoming technical upgrades may offer future support. Solana's network activity is robust, with potential for a price breakout, though sentiment remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent outflows from exchanges and increased minting suggest shifts in liquidity preferences, reflecting a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs indicate growing confidence, and potential bottoming signals from miner outflows suggest a favorable long-term outlook despite current technical weakness.

ETH: -0.1 — The shift towards inflationary supply and lack of immediate bullish technical signals suggest caution, though upcoming upgrades may provide future support.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout from current price levels make Solana relatively attractive, despite mixed sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current environment.

USDT: -0.3 — Recent outflows from exchanges and increased minting suggest a cautious market, but the stablecoin remains a safe haven amid uncertain conditions."
2024-08-14 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting positive sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto. Bitcoin's recent news of institutional interest through spot-ETF investments by major banks is a bullish signal, although miner capitulation suggests caution. Ethereum's shift to an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades present mixed signals. Solana's network activity is strong, but price direction remains uncertain. There is no significant news for Dogecoin, while Tether's large outflows from exchanges and new minting on Ethereum highlight liquidity shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest through spot-ETF investments indicates bullish sentiment, although miner capitulation suggests caution. Overall, BTC remains attractive given its potential bottoming event.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades could enhance long-term value. Current market data shows stability, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.4 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout support a positive outlook. However, mixed sentiment around price direction tempers enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable market data suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — Large outflows from exchanges and increased minting suggest a decrease in demand for stablecoins, as investors may be rotating into riskier assets."
2024-08-14 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest with significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting a potential bottoming event. However, technical indicators remain weak, with no clear buy signals. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming network upgrades present a mixed outlook, with no immediate bullish catalysts. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news and shows no strong technical signals. Tether's large outflows from exchanges indicate a shift in liquidity, possibly reflecting a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs suggest growing confidence, but technical indicators are not yet supportive of a strong buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed outlook with inflationary supply concerns balanced by upcoming network upgrades; no strong directional bias.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, supported by network upgrades, make Solana relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and weak technical indicators result in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite large outflows, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent given the overall cautious market sentiment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate level of volatility, as indicated by the VIX. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, as evidenced by significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks, suggesting a potential bullish sentiment. However, miner capitulation could indicate a possible price bottom, adding uncertainty. Ethereum faces a shift toward inflationary supply, which could weigh on its price, despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, signaling strong network usage, although its price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and new minting on Ethereum suggest liquidity shifts, possibly indicating a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional adoption through ETF investments and potential miner capitulation suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, despite technical indicators showing no clear buy signals.

ETH: 0.0 — The shift toward inflationary supply and mixed technical signals create a neutral stance, balanced by upcoming technical upgrades that may enhance future sentiment.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout provide a positive outlook, though mixed sentiment tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators maintain a hold position, with no clear signals to adjust exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — While there are large outflows from exchanges, the minting of new USDT suggests ongoing demand for liquidity, warranting a slight preference for holding stablecoins in a cautious market environment."
2024-08-14 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest in Bitcoin as evidenced by major banks increasing their positions in Bitcoin ETFs. This, coupled with miner capitulation, suggests a potential bottoming in Bitcoin's price cycle. Ethereum is experiencing a shift towards inflationary supply, which may dampen bullish sentiment, though upcoming technical upgrades could provide future support. Solana's network activity is robust, indicating strong underlying demand, although its price is at a critical juncture with mixed signals. Dogecoin lacks significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable position. Tether's large outflows and subsequent minting suggest liquidity shifts, with potential implications for market stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional adoption and miner capitulation suggest a potential price floor, making BTC relatively attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — The shift towards inflationary supply is a concern, balancing out potential future benefits from technical upgrades, resulting in a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout make SOL an appealing option for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals keeps DOGE in a neutral position, with no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing USDT exposure slightly is warranted."
2024-08-14 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest in Bitcoin as evidenced by major banks increasing their holdings in Bitcoin ETFs. This suggests growing confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades may create mixed sentiment, but the network's development continues to progress. Solana's network activity is robust, indicating strong usage, although price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, suggesting a stable but unremarkable position. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and subsequent minting highlight shifts in liquidity, possibly indicating a cautious stance among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest a potential price bottom, making Bitcoin relatively attractive in the current environment.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum faces inflationary pressures, the upcoming Pectra fork and continued development offer some positive sentiment, warranting a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Strong on-chain activity and potential technical upgrades position Solana favorably, though price uncertainty tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral, reflecting a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — The large outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a shift in liquidity preference, indicating a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings as risk appetite may increase."
2024-08-14 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Macroeconomic indicators show a stable environment with moderate volatility, but recent market data across cryptocurrencies indicates a lack of strong bullish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing institutional interest through spot-ETF investments, which could indicate long-term confidence, though miner capitulation suggests potential short-term pressure. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming technical changes may affect its attractiveness. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, suggesting potential for future growth, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant developments, while Tether's large withdrawals and minting suggest liquidity shifts in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs is a positive long-term signal, though current technical indicators are not strongly bullish. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — The shift to inflationary supply and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral stance. Await further developments from the Pectra fork.

2024-08-15 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 15.23. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 102.98, suggesting a robust dollar environment. Across the crypto market, there is a general lack of strong bullish signals, as evidenced by the absence of buy signals in trend and momentum indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced a recent dip below $58K, reflecting broader market sell-offs, while Ethereum is facing potential bearish patterns but holding key support levels. Regulatory concerns around Tether could impact its stability, although its recent investment in a Kuwaiti fintech signals ongoing expansion efforts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and sideways futures trading suggest caution. Despite increased on-chain activity, the lack of bullish technical signals and broader market sell-off warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals with a potential bearish pattern offset by support at $2,623. Given the oversold conditions, maintaining current exposure seems prudent.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite no significant news, SOL has shown slight price increases and stable on-chain activity. The absence of negative news and modest price uptick support a cautious positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, there is no compelling reason to adjust exposure at this time.

USDT: +0.1 — Regulatory risks are a concern, but in the current uncertain market environment, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent dip in Bitcoin's price and the sideways trading observed in futures. Bitcoin's price has experienced a significant decrease, and Ethereum is showing signs of a potential bearish pattern, although it remains above a key support level. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but their technical indicators do not suggest any immediate bullish momentum. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, though it continues to expand its adoption. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in interest rates or volatility, suggesting a neutral backdrop for crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure slightly, especially given the market's cautious sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish technical patterns, ETH is holding above a key support level, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical indicators suggest a change in position; maintaining a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes supports a hold position, as market sentiment remains neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven amid uncertainty."
2024-08-15 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip below $58K, indicating broader market sell-offs and a lack of strong directional conviction. Ethereum is showing signs of bearish technical patterns, although it remains near a key support level, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their price movements reflect the general market trend of slight decreases. USDT remains stable, but regulatory concerns could impact its future stability and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions warrant a cautious stance. Hold current positions with a slight reduction.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or strong technical signals. Maintain current holdings without changes.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding current positions.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market uncertainty and potential regulatory risks, increasing stablecoin exposure provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-15 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-08-15 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment in traditional markets. However, the crypto market is experiencing some turbulence, especially with Bitcoin's recent price dip and Ethereum's bearish technical pattern. Despite these challenges, Ethereum is holding a key support level, indicating potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether faces potential regulatory risks, but its recent investment in a Kuwaiti fintech suggests strategic expansion efforts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Maintain some exposure but reduce slightly due to market uncertainty.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish patterns, ETH is holding a key support level. Mixed signals warrant a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical changes. Maintain current exposure as market conditions remain stable.

DOGE: 0.1 — Slight bullish momentum observed in recent technicals. Consider a minor increase in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market volatility and potential regulatory risks, maintain a higher allocation to USDT for stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.23. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies shows a lack of strong bullish signals, with most assets trading within normal ranges and exhibiting no clear upward momentum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, reflecting broader market sell-offs, while Ethereum is hovering around a key support level with potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news or strong technical signals, indicating a neutral stance. Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish momentum suggest caution. The market sentiment is bearish, and the asset is under pressure from broader market sell-offs.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a bearish pattern, ETH is holding a key support level with potential for a rebound. The mixed signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a change in allocation. The asset remains stable but lacks a clear directional bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE shows some bullish momentum, the absence of significant news or strong technical indicators suggests maintaining the current position.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent, despite potential regulatory risks."
2024-08-15 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. However, the recent market data for major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH indicates a bearish trend, with prices declining and technical indicators showing no significant buy signals. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price dip, and Ethereum is facing potential bearish patterns, although it is holding a key support level. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their market data suggests a lack of bullish momentum. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, although regulatory risks could impact its future stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach. The market sentiment is bearish, with no immediate recovery signals.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite holding a key support level, the presence of a bearish pattern and lack of strong bullish momentum warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or bullish indicators; maintain current exposure as there is no clear directional signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, the lack of significant news and overall market sentiment suggests holding current positions.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of bearish trends in other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, despite potential regulatory risks."
2024-08-15 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip below $58,000 amid a broader crypto market sell-off. Despite this, on-chain activity for Bitcoin remains robust, suggesting underlying interest. Ethereum is showing signs of potential recovery, holding above a critical support level despite bearish technical patterns. Solana and Dogecoin have seen minor price fluctuations but lack significant news or momentum shifts. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, but it continues to expand its reach with investments in fintech. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution, though strong on-chain activity provides some support.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical indicators and news suggest a hold position as it hovers around key support levels.

SOL: -0.1 — Slight downward trend with no significant news or bullish signals, warranting a cautious stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum signals and stable price action suggest a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for capital preservation is prudent."
2024-08-15 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, pulling back under $58,000 amid broader market sell-offs, indicating a lack of strong bullish momentum. Ethereum is showing signs of potential bearish patterns, although it is holding a key support level, suggesting a possible rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have not seen significant news, but their price movements suggest a lack of strong directional bias. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability and attractiveness as a safe haven. Overall, the market is experiencing choppy trading with no clear bullish catalysts, prompting a more conservative approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Maintain exposure but consider reducing slightly due to broader market weakness.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish patterns, ETH is holding a key support level, indicating potential for stabilization. Maintain current exposure without changes.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without adjustments.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum indicators and slight price increases suggest a modest potential for upward movement. Consider a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market uncertainty and regulatory concerns, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT as a hedge against volatility is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of cautious sentiment and potential bearish signals, particularly in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price dip below $58,000, with sideways trading in futures markets indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Ethereum is facing potential downside risks due to a bearish technical pattern, though it is holding above a critical support level. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven movements, while Tether faces regulatory scrutiny but continues to expand its market presence. The macroeconomic backdrop, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach, with potential for capital preservation strategies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Maintain a reduced exposure due to potential downside risks.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical pattern and oversold conditions warrant a cautious stance, though support levels may offer some stability.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a strong allocation decision. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum signals in technical indicators provide a slight positive bias, though overall market sentiment remains neutral.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the uncertain market conditions and regulatory concerns, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is prudent."
2024-08-15 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.23. The broader crypto market is experiencing some turbulence, with Bitcoin recently dipping below $58K and showing choppy trading patterns. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns but remains above key support levels, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but DOGE is showing bullish momentum in recent technical indicators. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.1 — Recent price dip and lack of strong upward momentum suggest caution. Maintain current exposure with a slight reduction due to market uncertainty.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish patterns, ETH holds above key support with potential for a rebound. Neutral stance as technicals and sentiment are mixed.

SOL: +0.1 — No significant news, but stable technical indicators and normal on-chain activity suggest a slight preference for maintaining or slightly increasing exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators and no negative news suggest a moderate increase in allocation, capitalizing on potential upward movement.

USDT: +0.2 — Regulatory risks are a concern, but in a volatile market, maintaining a stablecoin reserve is prudent. Slight increase to hedge against broader market instability."
2024-08-15 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a sharp dip below $58,000 amid broader market sell-offs, reflecting a lack of strong directional conviction. Ethereum shows signs of potential bearishness with a rising wedge pattern, though it holds key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Dogecoin shows some bullish momentum in its technical indicators. Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, although it is expanding its adoption in the Gulf region. Overall, the market appears cautious, with some assets showing potential for rebound while others are under pressure from broader market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and lack of strong buy signals suggest caution. Maintain some exposure but reduce slightly due to market uncertainty.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bearish technical patterns and support holding. Hold current position until clearer direction emerges.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite no significant news, stable price and volume suggest maintaining current exposure with a slight preference for potential upside.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators and recent activity surge support a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.4 — Given market volatility and potential regulatory risks, maintain a higher allocation in stablecoins for risk management."
2024-08-15 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with some bearish undertones. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp dip, reflecting broader market sell-offs, though its on-chain activity shows some resilience with increased transactions and active wallets. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, yet it holds a crucial support level, indicating potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Dogecoin shows bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, but it continues to expand its adoption in new markets. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, suggesting a cautious approach to riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, on-chain activity is robust, and the overall market cap remains strong. The potential for recovery exists if market sentiment stabilizes.

ETH: 0.0 — Bearish technical patterns and recent sell pressure are counterbalanced by holding key support levels, resulting in a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.1 — No significant news or technical signals, but slight positive price movement suggests a cautious, minor increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators and increased transaction activity support a modest positive outlook.

USDT: -0.2 — Regulatory risks and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings, although it remains a safe haven in uncertain conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment indicates a mixed sentiment with some bullish momentum in certain assets, despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has shown a significant price increase in the last hour, breaking above the upper Bollinger Band, which suggests a potential breakout. However, recent news highlights some market uncertainty, with Bitcoin experiencing a sharp dip earlier. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns but is holding a key support level, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive price movements, with Dogecoin breaking above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating bullish momentum. Tether remains stable, but faces potential regulatory risks that could impact its future stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's breakout above the upper Bollinger Band and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains. However, news of a recent dip tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with bearish patterns and support holding. The potential for a rebound exists, but uncertainty remains high.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana has shown positive price movement and maintains bullish momentum, though lacking significant news to drive a stronger signal.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's breakout above the upper Bollinger Band and strong bullish momentum indicate a favorable environment for gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and potential regulatory risks, there is a preference to reduce exposure to USDT in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-15 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing signs of bullish momentum, while Ethereum faces potential downside risks due to technical patterns. Bitcoin's recent price volatility and sideways futures trading suggest uncertainty, but the recent buy signal and bullish momentum indicate potential for upward movement. Ethereum's technical indicators suggest a potential rebound, but the presence of a bearish pattern warrants caution. Solana has shown consistent bullish momentum without significant news, indicating steady interest. Dogecoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by bullish technical signals. Tether remains stable, but faces regulatory risks highlighted by recent news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price volatility, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and buy signal support a moderate increase in allocation, though caution is warranted due to recent market dips.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum's bearish pattern and potential downside risk suggest a slight reduction in exposure, despite some bullish momentum and support levels.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity make Solana relatively attractive, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and potential breakout indicate a favorable environment for Dogecoin, supporting a significant increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-15 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery after a recent dip. Despite a sharp sell-off that saw BTC fall below $58K, the asset has shown resilience with recent bullish momentum and a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band. Ethereum, while facing a potential bearish pattern, has maintained its key support level, indicating potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have both demonstrated bullish momentum, with DOGE showing a breakout pattern. However, regulatory concerns surrounding stablecoins like USDT are emerging, which could impact their attractiveness as safe havens.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent volatility, BTC is showing strong bullish momentum and a potential breakout, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.3 — Although there are concerns about a bearish pattern, ETH is holding key support levels and showing bullish momentum, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive price movement and bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable environment for SOL, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — DOGE is experiencing bullish momentum and a breakout pattern, but without significant news, a cautious increase in allocation is recommended.

USDT: -0.3 — With emerging regulatory risks and a generally bullish market sentiment, reducing exposure to USDT in favor of riskier assets is advisable."
2024-08-15 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum observed across several major cryptocurrencies, despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has shown strong bullish momentum, although recent news indicates some market uncertainty with a sharp sell-off and sideways futures trading. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with a bearish pattern identified, but it remains above key support levels, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have maintained bullish momentum without significant news impacting their outlook. Meanwhile, Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, but its recent investment in a Kuwaiti fintech indicates ongoing efforts to expand its adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's strong bullish momentum and on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to recent market sell-off news.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with a bearish pattern identified but also holding key support levels. This suggests a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a modestly positive outlook, although the absence of significant news keeps the score moderate.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's bullish momentum and buy signals suggest a slightly positive outlook, though the lack of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.2 — With bullish momentum in other assets and potential regulatory risks highlighted, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on risk-on sentiment in the broader market."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a recent downturn in prices across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have experienced significant decreases in the last hour. Despite this, technical indicators for most assets remain bullish, with short-term moving averages above long-term ones and MACD signals suggesting continued upward momentum. Bitcoin's recent price dip under $58K and Ethereum's bearish pattern detection are notable concerns, although Ethereum still holds above key support levels. Meanwhile, regulatory risks for stablecoins like USDT are highlighted by JPMorgan, potentially impacting its stability and attractiveness. In this environment, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight defensive tilt towards stablecoins may be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent price dip, BTC maintains strong technical indicators, suggesting potential for recovery. However, the recent market sell-off warrants caution.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a bearish pattern and oversold conditions. Holding above key support provides some optimism, but caution is advised given the potential downside.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent bullish momentum and lack of negative news make SOL relatively attractive, though the recent price drop suggests being watchful.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE shows bullish technical indicators, the lack of significant news and recent price decrease suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the recent market volatility and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a defensive buffer against further market downturns."
2024-08-15 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a notable downturn in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant declines. Bitcoin has dropped below $58,000, and Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, although it remains above a key support level. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen price decreases, with Solana breaking below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Despite the bearish sentiment, on-chain activity remains relatively stable, suggesting that the sell-off may not be driven by fundamental shifts. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its future utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, BTC maintains strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum indicators, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price decline warrant caution, though it remains above a key support level.

SOL: -0.1 — Significant price drop and breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band indicate caution, though on-chain activity remains stable.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a price decrease, on-chain activity is stable, and no significant news impacts sentiment.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT for stability and potential buying opportunities is prudent."
2024-08-15 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past four hours. This downturn is accompanied by a broader market sell-off, as indicated by the news of Bitcoin's price tumbling and Ethereum's bearish technical patterns. Despite the bearish sentiment, BTC and ETH still show some bullish technical indicators, such as the MACD being above the signal line in earlier hours, although these signals have weakened recently. USDT remains stable, with some regulatory concerns highlighted in the news, which could impact its future stability and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some earlier bullish signals, the recent significant price decline and lack of strong directional conviction suggest caution. Holding current positions while monitoring for further developments is prudent.

ETH: -0.5 — The bearish technical pattern and recent price drop, coupled with the news of potential further declines, warrant a reduction in exposure to ETH.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance on SOL is appropriate until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — The absence of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest holding current positions without making changes.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven is advisable, despite potential regulatory risks."
2024-08-15 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. This downturn is accompanied by a lack of bullish technical signals, as evidenced by the breakdowns below Bollinger Bands and the MACD being below the signal line for most assets. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets. Despite the bearish sentiment, USDT remains stable, with potential regulatory risks flagged, but also showing signs of adoption expansion.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The significant price decline and lack of bullish momentum suggest reducing exposure. The market sentiment is bearish, and the recent news indicates limited directional conviction.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions suggest caution. The potential for further downside is indicated by the rising wedge pattern identified by analysts.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines, there is no significant news or technical signals to suggest a strong directional move. Holding the current position is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Similar to SOL, DOGE shows no significant news or technical signals to warrant a change in position. Maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the bearish market conditions for other cryptocurrencies, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL, followed by a slight recovery in the last hour. Bitcoin's recent dip below $58K and Ethereum's bearish technical patterns suggest a lack of strong bullish momentum, despite some signs of potential rebounds. Solana and Dogecoin have shown mixed signals, with no significant news to drive sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but regulatory concerns could impact its future stability. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a cautious risk environment, favoring a balanced approach between risk assets and stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, BTC shows some recovery and potential for stabilization. However, the lack of strong bullish signals warrants a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions suggest caution. While there is potential for a rebound, the risk of further declines remains.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent price increases and normal on-chain activity indicate some resilience, but the absence of strong bullish momentum suggests a moderate positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, DOGE remains neutral, lacking clear direction for capital allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and regulatory risks, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a hedge against volatility in risk assets."
2024-08-15 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX and a steady U.S. Dollar Index. However, the crypto market has experienced some turbulence, particularly with Bitcoin, which has seen a significant price drop and is trading below key technical levels. Ethereum is showing signs of potential recovery despite bearish patterns, while Solana and Dogecoin have seen slight price increases without significant news impacts. Tether remains stable but faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its future use and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin's recent price drop and lack of bullish momentum suggest caution. The market sentiment is bearish, and the asset is trading below key technical levels.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite bearish technical patterns, Ethereum is holding above key support levels with potential for a rebound, making it slightly more attractive compared to BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's consistent price increases and stable on-chain activity, coupled with no negative news, make it a relatively attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant changes in market data or sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the current market volatility and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2024-08-15 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of slight bullish and bearish signals across different assets. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, reflecting broader market volatility, while Ethereum is showing potential for a rebound despite bearish technical patterns. Solana and Dogecoin have seen modest price increases, though without significant news to drive strong sentiment shifts. Tether remains stable, but regulatory risks loom, potentially affecting its future stability. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, but the recent crypto market volatility indicates traders are still wary.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite potential for a rebound, bearish patterns and mixed signals warrant a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent price increases and normal on-chain activity indicate moderate potential for growth, supporting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment; maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory concerns, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential downturns."
