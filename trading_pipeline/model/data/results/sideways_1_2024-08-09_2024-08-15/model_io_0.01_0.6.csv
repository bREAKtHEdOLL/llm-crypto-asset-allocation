2024-08-09 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since February 2022. This surge has lifted the overall crypto market, recovering the total market capitalization above $2.1 trillion. However, Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, facing skepticism about its price action. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is struggling with declining investor interest and negative sentiment. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment make Bitcoin an attractive asset. The recent rally and recovery in market confidence support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite underperformance, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive. However, caution is warranted due to recent sell pressure and negative sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF in Brazil enhance its attractiveness. Technical indicators also support a bullish stance.

DOGE: -0.3 — Negative sentiment and declining investor interest suggest reducing exposure to Dogecoin, despite holding none currently.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant rebound, marking its strongest rally since February 2022. This has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, raising concerns about its current market position. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest increasing, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Dogecoin, however, is facing declining investor interest and negative sentiment, while Tether is seeing increased activity with significant transfers to exchanges, indicating heightened market engagement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with significant price recovery and positive news sentiment, suggesting a favorable environment for increased allocation.

**ETH: 0.0** — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative news sentiment warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

**SOL: +0.5** — Institutional interest and positive technical indicators support a moderate increase in allocation, reflecting confidence in Solana's potential growth.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With declining interest and negative sentiment, maintaining a neutral position is prudent given the lack of compelling bullish signals.

**USDT: -0.4** — As market confidence returns and risk appetite increases, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-08-09 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong recovery, evidenced by a significant price surge and positive on-chain activity. This rebound is contributing to a broader crypto market recovery, lifting total market capitalization. Ethereum, however, is underperforming, facing negative sentiment and price action despite the general market uplift. Solana is experiencing positive developments with institutional interest, as seen with the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Dogecoin is struggling with declining investor interest and negative news sentiment. Meanwhile, Tether's increased exchange activity suggests heightened market liquidity and potential capital rotation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant price recovery and positive news sentiment, making it a favorable asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum is underperforming with negative sentiment and weak price action, suggesting a need to reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF in Brazil support a moderate increase in allocation to capitalize on potential growth.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and negative sentiment, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of recovery and increased risk appetite, there is a rationale to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-09 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong recovery momentum, rebounding from recent declines and stabilizing near $61.5K. This recovery is supported by positive on-chain activity and bullish technical indicators. Ethereum, however, is underperforming relative to other major assets, with analysts expressing concerns about its weak price action. Solana has seen some positive developments, such as the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, which indicates growing institutional interest. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest and value, while Tether is actively moving large amounts to exchanges, suggesting increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong recovery momentum and positive market sentiment, supported by bullish technical indicators and on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.3 — Underperformance relative to the broader market and negative sentiment from analysts, despite bullish technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments with the launch of a new ETF and easing supply concerns, coupled with bullish technical indicators.

DOGE: 0.0 — Declining investor interest and negative sentiment, but no current holdings to reduce.

USDT: -0.5 — Increased market activity and potential capital rotation into riskier assets as market sentiment improves."
2024-08-09 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong recovery momentum, rebounding significantly after recent declines. This has bolstered trader confidence, as evidenced by the surge in transactions and active wallets. Ethereum, however, is underperforming relative to the broader market, with concerns about its price action and sentiment being less favorable. Solana has seen some positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, although technical indicators remain mixed. Dogecoin is experiencing declining interest and value, overshadowed by other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether is seeing increased activity, with substantial amounts moved to exchanges, indicating heightened market engagement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong recovery momentum and positive news sentiment, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish technical indicators, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment in the news warrant caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and ETF launch provide a positive backdrop, although technical signals are not strongly bullish.

DOGE: 0.0 — Declining interest and negative news sentiment balance out the technical buy signals, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased market activity and a bullish outlook for other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-08-09 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a significant rebound, marking a strong recovery from recent declines. This upward momentum in Bitcoin has lifted broader market confidence, although Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, facing skepticism about its short-term prospects. Solana is seeing institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, which could bolster its appeal. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is struggling with declining investor interest, and Tether is witnessing increased activity, potentially indicating higher market liquidity or preparation for further market moves.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive market sentiment, along with bullish technical indicators, suggest a favorable outlook for further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical signals, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment in the news warrant a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest through the new ETF and easing supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, despite mixed technical signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of investor interest and negative news sentiment offset any technical buy signals, suggesting a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — Increased market activity and potential capital rotation into riskier assets suggest reducing stablecoin exposure to capitalize on bullish market conditions."
2024-08-09 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a strong recovery, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing after a significant rally. This positive movement has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, facing criticism for its weak price action. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, despite initial concerns over token supply. Dogecoin, however, is facing declining investor interest and value, as attention shifts to other meme coins. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations, with significant USDT transfers to exchanges indicating increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment, combined with bullish technical indicators, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum signals, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment suggest a cautious approach, maintaining a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF, along with consistent buy signals, support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases with Bitcoin's rally, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-09 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong recovery, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing around $61.5K. This rebound has lifted the broader crypto market, though Ethereum has underperformed, facing significant declines and negative sentiment. Solana has seen positive developments with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil and clarification on token supply concerns, which may bolster investor confidence. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest, while Tether is seeing increased market activity with substantial transfers to exchanges, indicating potential capital rotation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news flow suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the Solana ETF and clarification on supply concerns, along with stable market data, support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shows signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets like BTC and SOL is advisable."
2024-08-09 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a notable rebound in Bitcoin's price, which has surged nearly 12% amid a broader crypto market recovery. This rebound has lifted the total crypto market capitalization above $2.1 trillion, indicating renewed trader confidence. However, Ethereum has underperformed, experiencing a significant decline, which has raised concerns among analysts. Solana has seen positive developments with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, reflecting growing institutional interest, although there were initial concerns about token supply. Dogecoin is facing a steep decline as investor interest shifts to other meme coins. Tether remains stable, with significant USDT transfers to exchanges, suggesting increased market activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news sentiment, coupled with a buy signal from trend indicators, suggest a favorable outlook. The recent surge in price and market confidence supports increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative news sentiment indicate caution. The lack of bullish momentum signals further support a reduced allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments such as the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil and clarification on token supply concerns enhance its attractiveness. The buy signal from trend indicators also supports a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and negative news sentiment, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall positive market sentiment and Bitcoin's strong performance, there is a rationale for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-09 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment reflects a cautious optimism, with Bitcoin leading a broader crypto market recovery, rebounding significantly after recent declines. Bitcoin's strong rally and stabilization near $61.5K have boosted trader confidence, while Ethereum underperforms, struggling with weak price action and negative sentiment. Solana has seen mixed news, with concerns about token supply being addressed and a new ETF launch in Brazil, indicating institutional interest. Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and value, while Tether is experiencing increased activity with significant transfers to exchanges, suggesting heightened market engagement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment, coupled with a buy signal from trend indicators, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite buy signals from trend indicators, Ethereum's underperformance and negative news sentiment suggest a cautious approach, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — The resolution of supply concerns and the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil highlight growing institutional interest, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases with Bitcoin's recovery, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-09 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall crypto market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a rebound, posting a significant rally that has bolstered trader confidence. Despite this, Ethereum is underperforming, with concerns about its relative weakness compared to other major assets. Solana has seen mixed signals with concerns over token supply being addressed and institutional interest growing with a new ETF launch.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong recovery momentum and positive news sentiment, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains. The recent rally and market confidence support an increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment relative to other assets warrant a cautious approach. The lack of bullish signals and weak price action suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's institutional interest and resolution of supply concerns provide a positive backdrop. However, technical indicators remain weak, so a moderate increase in allocation is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin is facing declining interest and negative sentiment, but without current holdings, there is no need to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other assets is advisable. The increased exchange activity also suggests a shift towards riskier assets."

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market is experiencing a recovery, with Bitcoin leading the charge by posting a significant rally, which has lifted market sentiment. Despite Bitcoin's strong performance, Ethereum is underperforming, with concerns about its price action relative to other major assets. Solana is seeing increased institutional interest, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil, although technical indicators remain mixed. Dogecoin is facing a decline in investor interest and value, while Tether is seeing increased market activity with significant transfers to exchanges, suggesting heightened trading interest.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable outlook. The recent price rally and increased market confidence warrant a higher allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment indicate caution. Maintain a slightly reduced exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and the launch of a Solana ETF are positive, but technical indicators are mixed. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and negative sentiment, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to allocate more capital to growth assets."
2024-08-09 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery rally, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing around $61.5K. This rebound has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, showing signs of weakness relative to other major assets. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, while Dogecoin continues to struggle with declining investor interest. Tether remains stable, with significant transfers to exchanges indicating heightened market activity, possibly as traders prepare for increased volatility or opportunities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and clarification on supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop, though technicals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.1 — While there is increased market activity, maintaining some exposure to USDT as a hedge against volatility is advisable given the mixed signals across other assets."
2024-08-09 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery after a significant rally, while other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana are experiencing downward pressure. Bitcoin's recent surge has bolstered trader confidence, but Ethereum is underperforming, raising concerns about its relative weakness. Solana has faced supply concerns, but institutional interest remains strong, as evidenced by the launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest, with its value dropping significantly. Meanwhile, Tether is seeing increased activity, with substantial amounts moved to exchanges, indicating heightened market engagement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent rally and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive sentiment, although caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative news sentiment suggest a cautious approach, despite some on-chain activity surges.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest and the launch of a Solana ETF provide some support, but technical indicators remain weak.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a lack of positive momentum or news, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the mixed market conditions and increased market activity, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-09 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery, having surged nearly 12% recently, signaling renewed trader confidence. However, Ethereum is underperforming relative to other major assets, facing significant declines and negative sentiment. Solana is experiencing mixed signals with concerns over token supply being addressed and institutional interest increasing through a new ETF launch in Brazil. Dogecoin is facing a steep decline with waning investor interest, while Tether is seeing increased market activity with significant transfers to exchanges, suggesting heightened trading activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment, despite broader market recovery, indicate a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and clarification on supply concerns provide a moderate positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and negative sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Increased market activity and capital rotation suggest reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of riskier assets."
2024-08-09 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a notable recovery, surging nearly 12% and stabilizing after a strong rally. This rebound has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, facing significant declines and negative sentiment. Solana has seen mixed signals with institutional interest growing, evidenced by the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, but concerns over token supply have been addressed. Dogecoin continues to struggle with declining investor interest and sharp value losses. Meanwhile, Tether is experiencing heightened activity, with significant transfers to exchanges and plans to expand its workforce, suggesting a robust operational outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news flow suggest a favorable environment for further gains, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant caution, suggesting a reduced exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and clarification on supply concerns provide a positive outlook, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and negative sentiment, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases with Bitcoin's strong performance, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery rally, marking its strongest single-day performance since early 2022. This has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, showing signs of weakness relative to other major assets. Solana has seen positive institutional interest with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, while Dogecoin continues to struggle with declining investor interest. Tether remains stable with significant transfers to exchanges, indicating active market participation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive news flow suggest continued upward momentum. The recent surge in on-chain activity further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's relative underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a cautious stance, especially given its weak technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, making it an attractive allocation in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining interest and no significant positive developments, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases with the broader market recovery, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-08-09 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a significant recovery and leading the crypto market's rebound. This resurgence has been bolstered by positive news, such as Bitcoin's substantial rally and stabilization above key levels. Ethereum, however, is underperforming relative to other major assets, facing negative sentiment and price pressure. Solana has seen positive developments with institutional interest, while Dogecoin is struggling with declining investor interest and negative sentiment. Tether remains stable, with increased market activity and plans for expansion, indicating a robust position in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum. The asset is leading the market rebound, making it an attractive allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment, despite the broader market recovery, warrant caution. Current holdings should be reduced slightly.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive institutional developments and stable on-chain activity support a modest increase in allocation to Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — Negative sentiment and declining investor interest suggest no immediate action is necessary. Maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is an opportunity to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-09 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery rally, surging nearly 12% and stabilizing around $61,500. This rebound has bolstered trader confidence, although Ethereum has underperformed, showing relative weakness amid the broader crypto recovery. Solana has seen positive developments, including the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, which could attract institutional interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin continues to face declining investor interest, and Tether's increased activity on exchanges suggests heightened market activity, possibly indicating a shift in capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive market sentiment, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable outlook for further gains.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment warrant a cautious approach, especially given its weak price action relative to other assets.

SOL: +0.5 — The launch of a Solana ETF in Brazil and clarification on token supply concerns provide a supportive backdrop for potential growth, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and ongoing negative sentiment, there is no compelling reason to allocate capital to Dogecoin at this time.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of recovery, there is a potential rotation out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-09 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a strong recovery, rising nearly 12% recently, and stabilizing around $61,500. This rebound has bolstered confidence across the crypto market, lifting total market capitalization. However, Ethereum is underperforming, with significant declines over the past week, raising concerns about its relative weakness. Solana is experiencing positive institutional interest, highlighted by the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, although concerns about token supply have been addressed by Binance. Dogecoin is facing a decline in investor interest, while Tether's increased activity suggests heightened market engagement, with substantial USDT transfers to exchanges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment make it less appealing, justifying a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and clarification on supply concerns provide a positive outlook for Solana, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and declining investor interest, Dogecoin remains neutral with no compelling reason to allocate capital.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in risk assets like BTC and SOL, there is a rationale to reduce stablecoin exposure and rotate capital into more promising opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading a recovery rally, gaining nearly 12% and stabilizing around $61.5K. This rebound has lifted the broader crypto market, although Ethereum has underperformed, showing a significant drop over the past week. Solana has seen positive developments with the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, indicating growing institutional interest, despite earlier concerns about token supply. Dogecoin is experiencing a decline in investor interest and value, while Tether shows increased market activity with significant transfers to exchanges, possibly indicating preparation for increased trading activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment relative to other assets warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the Solana ETF and easing supply concerns, combined with recent price increases, support a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite the bullish sentiment in the market, the increased transfer of USDT to exchanges suggests a strategic reserve of capital, justifying a slight increase in stablecoin allocation for flexibility."
2024-08-09 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong rebound, suggesting renewed trader confidence. Despite this, Ethereum is underperforming, struggling with weak price action compared to other major assets. Solana is gaining institutional interest, evidenced by the launch of a new ETF in Brazil, which could bolster its appeal. Dogecoin is facing a decline in interest and value, as attention shifts to other meme coins. Tether's increased activity, with significant transfers to exchanges, indicates heightened market activity, possibly preparing for increased trading or liquidity needs.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent rally and strong recovery signal a positive sentiment, supported by increased market confidence and a rebound in price.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the broader market recovery, Ethereum's underperformance and negative sentiment keep it neutral, with no clear signals for immediate capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and positive news regarding the Solana ETF in Brazil enhance its attractiveness, suggesting potential for growth.

DOGE: 0.0 — With declining investor interest and no significant positive developments, Dogecoin remains neutral, lacking strong signals for allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — As the market shows signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT, although its role as a liquidity provider remains important."
2024-08-10 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the VIX at 20.48, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index at 103.14. The crypto market shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin maintaining stability after a recent rally but lacking strong momentum. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana's recent whale transfer to Binance suggests potential liquidation, which could increase selling pressure. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news or market movements. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, reflecting its continued demand as a stablecoin, although it faces legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the lack of strong bullish signals, Bitcoin's stability and resilience in the current range suggest a cautious optimism. The macro environment does not indicate significant risk, supporting a slight positive bias.

ETH: -0.5 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a bearish outlook. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate potential downside risk.

SOL: -0.3 — The whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential selling pressure. Despite some bullish momentum signals, the risk of a price drop warrants a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the mixed signals and potential bearish trends in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk in this uncertain environment."
2024-08-10 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) is displaying resilience, maintaining its price within a stable range despite subdued market momentum. Ethereum (ETH) is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has driven its price down. Solana (SOL) experienced a notable whale transfer to an exchange, potentially indicating a liquidation event. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks significant news, and Tether (USDT) continues to grow its market cap, although it's embroiled in a legal dispute with Celsius. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious market approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin's stability and resilience in the face of recent market fluctuations make it a relatively safe allocation, though the lack of strong momentum suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.5 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and the resulting price pressure indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given the small current holding.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, warranting a slight reduction in exposure despite the current holding.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and the legal uncertainties, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility and potential downturns."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is holding steady after a recent rally but lacks strong momentum, as indicated by subdued market activity and a lack of significant price movement. Ethereum is under pressure due to a significant sell-off by market makers, which has driven its price down. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation, which could weigh on its price. Dogecoin lacks significant news or market activity, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, indicating strong demand for stability in uncertain market conditions. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable dollar index, suggests a cautious approach might be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Bitcoin is showing resilience and maintaining its price level despite a lack of strong momentum. Given its steady position, a moderate positive allocation is justified to maintain exposure.

**ETH: -0.3** — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach. Reducing exposure is prudent given the recent downward pressure.

**SOL: -0.2** — The large whale transfer to an exchange indicates potential selling pressure. While there is bullish momentum, the risk of further downside warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate for Dogecoin.

**USDT: +0.2** — Given the high market cap and current macroeconomic conditions, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides stability amidst mixed signals in other assets."
2024-08-10 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish undertone. Bitcoin shows resilience despite subdued momentum, maintaining its range after a recent rally. Ethereum faces pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs, which has led to a notable price decline. Solana is experiencing potential distribution pressure due to a large whale transfer to Binance, indicating possible liquidation. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. Tether's market cap continues to grow, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market volatility, although it faces legal challenges from Celsius.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and stable price range suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent sell-offs have pressured ETH's price, and with no bullish technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious approach despite bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and liquidity advantage."
2024-08-10 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing resilience, maintaining its position after a recent rally, but lacks strong momentum, as indicated by subdued market activity. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has impacted its price. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential selling pressure. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its price. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, reflecting its continued demand as a stablecoin amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a lack of strong momentum, BTC's resilience and stable price action make it a relatively safe allocation in a cautious market environment.

ETH: -0.4 — Recent heavy sell-offs by market makers have created downward pressure, making ETH less attractive in the short term.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange suggests potential selling pressure, warranting caution despite its previous bullish momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market signals and recent increase in market cap, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven in a potentially volatile environment."
2024-08-10 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing resilience after a recent rally, maintaining its position within a consolidation range despite subdued market momentum. Ethereum is under pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has led to a notable price decline. Solana experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation or distribution, which could impact its price negatively. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news affecting its market dynamics. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap has reached a new high, but it faces legal challenges that could impact its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and consolidation within a range suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its current market cap stability and on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.5 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of bullish technical signals indicate a need to reduce exposure, as the asset faces downward pressure.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to Binance signals potential selling pressure, and the lack of strong buy signals suggests a cautious stance, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

2024-08-10 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with BTC maintaining stability after a recent rally, though its momentum remains subdued. Ethereum is under pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, contributing to a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a large whale transfer to an exchange, potentially indicating distribution, while Dogecoin shows no significant news or changes. Tether has reached a new market cap high, but faces legal challenges, indicating a mixed sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable USD, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets, favoring a balanced portfolio with some stablecoin exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC shows resilience and stability, making it a relatively safer bet in a cautious market environment.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell-off pressure and lack of positive momentum suggest reducing exposure to ETH, especially given the current holdings.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in data, maintaining a neutral position on DOGE is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the cautious market sentiment and legal uncertainties surrounding other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is advisable for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward price movements observed in BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. BTC remains stable after a recent rally, though trading momentum is subdued. ETH is experiencing pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has impacted its price negatively. SOL has seen a large whale transfer to Binance, indicating potential selling pressure. DOGE has shown bullish momentum despite the absence of significant news. USDT's market cap has reached a new high, but legal issues with Celsius could introduce uncertainty. Given the current macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, the market seems to be in a consolidation phase with a cautious risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — BTC is showing resilience with slight upward price movement and stable on-chain activity. However, the lack of strong momentum signals suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite a recent price increase, the heavy sell-off by market makers and lack of strong technical signals warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — While there is potential selling pressure from a large whale transfer, the recent bullish momentum and price increase suggest a cautious positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — DOGE has shown bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, but without significant news, a modest increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: 0.0 — With the market showing signs of cautious optimism, maintaining current USDT levels is prudent to balance risk exposure."
2024-08-10 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish undertone. Bitcoin is holding steady after a recent rally, but momentum remains subdued, indicating a period of consolidation. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana is experiencing potential distribution or liquidation activity, as indicated by a large whale transfer to an exchange. Dogecoin shows no significant news or changes, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, but it faces legal challenges, which could impact its stability. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high VIX and stable S&P 500, suggests cautious market conditions, favoring a balanced approach with a slight preference for stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite subdued momentum, Bitcoin's stability and resilience in price suggest a cautious buy, maintaining exposure in anticipation of potential upward movement.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure and lack of bullish signals indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given the minimal current holdings.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer suggests potential selling pressure, warranting a slight reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market conditions and legal uncertainties surrounding Tether, a slight increase in stablecoin holdings provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-10 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward price movements across most major cryptocurrencies in the past hours. Bitcoin shows resilience despite subdued momentum, maintaining its range after a recent rally. Ethereum is experiencing pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has impacted its price negatively. Solana's market activity is highlighted by a large whale transfer to Binance, suggesting potential distribution or liquidation. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news affecting its sentiment. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap has reached a new high, though it faces legal challenges with Celsius, which could impact its stability perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin shows resilience with consistent on-chain activity and a stable price range, suggesting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: -0.2 — Recent heavy sell-offs by market makers and lack of positive momentum indicate a need to reduce exposure slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the large whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential selling pressure, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the legal uncertainties and the stablecoin's recent market cap increase, a slight preference for holding USDT for stability is advisable."
2024-08-10 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing resilience with its price holding steady after a recent rally, though market momentum remains subdued. Ethereum faces pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs, which has dragged its price down significantly. Solana experienced a large whale transfer to Binance, suggesting potential distribution or liquidation, which could indicate bearish sentiment. Dogecoin shows bullish momentum with increased on-chain activity but lacks significant news catalysts. Tether continues to grow its market cap, signaling strong demand for stablecoins, but faces legal challenges that could impact sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's price stability and resilience suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.5 — Recent heavy sell-offs by market-makers and lack of positive news create a bearish outlook, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange indicates potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious approach despite bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity provide a slight positive bias, though the lack of significant news limits confidence.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of mixed market conditions and potential bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin is holding steady after a recent rally, despite subdued momentum and a quiet trading period. Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, indicating potential selling pressure. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether has reached a new market cap high amid legal disputes. The macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment, with moderate volatility and no extreme movements in key indicators like interest rates and the S&P 500.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC shows resilience and a consistent buy signal from trend indicators. Its steady price action amidst a quiet trading period suggests a moderate bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — The heavy sell-off by market makers and the resulting price pressure warrant caution. While technical indicators are positive, the recent news suggests potential downside risks.

SOL: -0.1 — The large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, despite positive technical indicators. This warrants a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust exposure at this time.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed signals in the broader market, maintaining some exposure to USDT as a hedge against volatility is prudent, despite the recent legal issues."
2024-08-10 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing buy signals on short-term moving averages, indicating potential upward momentum. However, Bitcoin's momentum remains subdued, and Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana experienced a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting potential liquidation, which could impact its price negatively. Dogecoin remains stable without significant news, while Tether's market cap continues to grow, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, encouraging selective risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and buy signals from moving averages suggest a cautious increase in allocation, supported by stable macro conditions.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent heavy sell-offs and price pressure warrant a slight reduction in exposure, despite bullish technical signals.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange raises concerns about potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and the need for a safe haven, increasing USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity in the portfolio."
2024-08-10 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bearish undertones due to macroeconomic factors such as a relatively high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility. Bitcoin shows resilience despite a recent decline, maintaining stability within a trading range. Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers, which has driven its price down. Solana's recent whale transfer to Binance suggests potential liquidation, raising concerns about short-term downward pressure. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, reflecting its continued demand as a stablecoin, although legal issues with Celsius could introduce some uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's stability and resilience in a quiet market suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell-off pressure from market makers and a lack of bullish news create a bearish outlook, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to Binance indicates potential selling pressure, suggesting a cautious approach and slight reduction in holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT for stability and liquidity is advisable."
2024-08-10 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing resilience but lacking strong momentum, while Ethereum faces selling pressure from major market makers. Solana has seen a significant whale transfer, suggesting potential liquidation, which could impact its price. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, and Tether continues to grow its market cap amidst legal challenges. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a preference for stability and liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin is showing resilience with a buy signal from short-term MAs, but the lack of strong momentum and subdued market activity suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the heavy sell-off by market makers and recent price pressure warrant a cautious stance, especially given the minimal current holdings.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to an exchange suggests potential selling pressure, which could negatively impact price, prompting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential for further volatility, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides liquidity and risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 20.48. The U.S. dollar index remains strong, which could exert some pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's price is holding steady after a recent rally, but overall market momentum remains subdued. Ethereum is facing sell-off pressures from market-makers, which has significantly impacted its price. Solana witnessed a large whale transfer to Binance, suggesting potential selling pressure. Dogecoin has seen increased on-chain activity but lacks significant news catalysts. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst legal disputes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and buy signals from trend indicators suggest a moderate positive outlook. On-chain activity remains robust, supporting a slight increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Heavy sell-off pressure from market-makers and a lack of bullish momentum signal a cautious stance. The current holding is minimal, so the score reflects a preference to avoid increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The whale transfer to Binance suggests potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious approach. The current holding is significant, so a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased on-chain activity is noted, but without significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and the strong demand for USDT, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-10 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience after a recent rally but lacking strong momentum. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by major market makers, which has led to a notable price decline. Solana is experiencing potential distribution or liquidation activity, as indicated by a large whale transfer to Binance. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. Tether's market cap has reached a new all-time high, although it faces legal challenges. The macroeconomic environment, with a stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and the buy signal from moving averages suggest a moderate positive outlook. However, the lack of strong upward momentum tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell pressure from market makers and a lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious stance on ETH, especially given the minimal current holdings.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential selling pressure, justifying a slight reduction in exposure despite the buy signal from moving averages.

DOGE: +0.1 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, DOGE maintains a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to its recent bullish momentum signal.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and the legal uncertainties surrounding Tether, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-10 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a period of consolidation, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite subdued momentum. Ethereum faces selling pressure from market makers, while Solana has seen significant whale activity, potentially indicating a shift in holdings. Dogecoin is experiencing bullish momentum, possibly due to technical factors, while Tether's market cap has reached a new high amidst ongoing legal disputes. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with a preference for stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin is showing resilience with a stable price despite subdued momentum. The recent surge in on-chain activity suggests potential for upward movement, but caution is warranted due to the lack of strong bullish signals.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum is under pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs, which has led to a notable price decline. The lack of positive news and technical signals suggests reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The large whale transfer to Binance indicates potential selling pressure. Despite normal on-chain activity, the lack of strong buy signals and potential liquidation risk warrants caution.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin is experiencing bullish momentum with a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band. The absence of negative news and positive technical indicators support a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — With the current cautious market sentiment and ongoing legal disputes, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT is prudent for risk management, despite the stablecoin's high market cap."
2024-08-10 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing resilience but lacking strong momentum, while Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana has seen a potential bearish signal with a large whale transfer to an exchange, suggesting possible liquidation. Dogecoin has shown some bullish momentum but lacks significant news to drive further price action. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins, possibly reflecting cautious market sentiment amid broader economic uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite subdued momentum, BTC's resilience and stable price action suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.5 — Continued sell-off pressure from market makers and lack of positive news weigh on ETH, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — The large whale transfer to an exchange indicates potential selling pressure, warranting a cautious stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, DOGE's recent bullish momentum and price breakout signal a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainties, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safety net against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with BTC showing resilience despite subdued momentum and a recent rally. Ethereum faces pressure from significant market-maker sell-offs, which has dragged its price down. Solana is experiencing potential distribution or liquidation activity, as indicated by a large whale transfer to Binance. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether continues to grow its market cap, although it faces legal challenges. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a slight preference for riskier assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — BTC shows resilience with a buy signal from short-term MAs and bullish momentum. Despite subdued market momentum, its stability and on-chain activity support a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure from market-makers and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the minimal current holding.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a bullish momentum signal, the large whale transfer to Binance suggests potential downward pressure. Hold current exposure until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and technical indicators suggest a slight increase in allocation, though lack of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.5 — With a stable macro environment and some bullish signals in other assets, reduce exposure to USDT to rotate capital into riskier assets with more upside potential."
2024-08-10 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience despite recent consolidation and Ethereum facing pressure from significant sell-offs by market-makers. Solana's potential liquidation signals some caution, while Dogecoin maintains bullish momentum without significant news-driven catalysts. Tether's market cap growth suggests strong demand for stablecoins, but legal disputes may introduce some uncertainty. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, indicates a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent resilience and bullish technical signals suggest a moderate buy, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite technical buy signals, the heavy market-maker sell-off introduces caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — The potential whale liquidation introduces uncertainty, balancing out the bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Strong technical indicators and lack of negative news support a modest buy signal, although low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive market outlook, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to allocate more towards risk assets is advisable."
2024-08-10 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience and maintaining its position after a recent rally, despite subdued market momentum. Ethereum is under pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, which has dragged its price down. Solana faces potential distribution or liquidation concerns following a large whale transfer to Binance. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news impacting its market position. Tether continues to grow, reaching a new all-time high in market cap, although it faces legal challenges. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable traditional markets, suggests a balanced approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows resilience with bullish momentum signals and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure from market makers and lack of bullish technical signals indicate a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.2 — Potential liquidation concerns from a large whale transfer to Binance warrant a slightly negative outlook despite bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consistent bullish momentum and technical signals support a modest positive allocation, though lacking significant news catalysts.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed market signals and stable macroeconomic indicators, maintaining current USDT holdings seems prudent as a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-10 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin maintaining a steady position after a recent rally, though broader market momentum remains subdued. Ethereum faces downward pressure due to significant sell-offs by market makers, while Solana experiences potential distribution signals from large whale transfers. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's market cap has reached a new high, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst some legal disputes. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility and stable conditions, with no extreme movements in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite subdued market momentum, Bitcoin's technical indicators show bullish signals, and on-chain activity remains robust, suggesting potential for moderate gains.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach; minimal current holdings justify a slight reduction.

SOL: 0.0 — While there is bullish momentum, the large whale transfer to an exchange raises caution, balancing out the score to neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consistent bullish technical signals and lack of negative news provide a slight positive bias, though no strong catalysts are present.

USDT: -0.2 — With stablecoin demand high, maintaining some exposure is prudent, but slight reduction is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a moderately stable environment with a 10-Year Treasury Yield at 3.94% and the S&P 500 at 5344.24, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. The U.S. Dollar Index at 103.14 and a relatively high VIX at 20.48 indicate some market caution. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows stable technical indicators with a consistent buy signal, while Ethereum faces pressure from significant sell-offs by market makers. Solana's whale activity suggests potential volatility, and Dogecoin maintains bullish momentum without significant news. Tether's market cap growth suggests increasing demand for stablecoins, likely as a hedge against volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with stable price action, suggest a positive outlook. However, the overall market sentiment remains cautious, warranting a moderate score.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant sell-off pressure from market makers and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the minimal current holding.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the large whale transfer to an exchange introduces potential downside risk. Neutral stance given the mixed signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish technical indicators and no adverse news support a slight increase in allocation, but the absence of significant news keeps the score moderate.

USDT: +0.1 — With increasing market cap and legal challenges, USDT remains a safe haven amid potential market volatility, justifying a slight increase in allocation."
2024-08-11 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a strong buy signal with consistent upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a significant rally but is facing resistance, suggesting potential volatility. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) both exhibit bullish momentum, with DOGE showing signs of a breakout. Tether (USDT) remains stable, with its market cap reaching a new milestone, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amidst market fluctuations. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable indices, supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Consistent bullish momentum and strong technical indicators suggest further upside potential. No significant news suggests stability in sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, ETH faces resistance and lacks bullish technical signals, indicating a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive technical signals suggest potential for further gains, although no significant news supports a stronger signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and potential breakout signal a positive outlook, but reliance on hype cycles warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-11 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum signals. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity, though no significant news has been reported. Ethereum (ETH) has seen a recent rally but faces resistance, indicating mixed sentiment. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are both showing bullish technical indicators, with DOGE experiencing significant price increases potentially driven by speculative interest. Tether (USDT) remains a strong stablecoin choice, having reached a significant market cap milestone and expanding its utility through the Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest continued bullish sentiment, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, ETH faces resistance and lacks clear bullish signals, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and technical indicators support a positive outlook for SOL, though no significant news is present.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price breakout and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish signal, though the hype-driven nature warrants caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is advisable."
2024-08-11 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and positive momentum. Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong upward momentum, supported by robust on-chain activity. Ethereum has experienced a significant rally but is facing resistance, which could indicate potential volatility. Solana and Dogecoin both show bullish momentum, with Dogecoin experiencing speculative interest driven by hype cycles. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance as a stablecoin, though its role as a safe haven may be less attractive in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum suggest continued upward potential, supported by high on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, the overall bullish momentum and recent rally indicate potential for further gains, albeit with caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, along with normal on-chain activity, make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While driven by speculative interest, the consistent breakout signals and bullish momentum warrant a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is less need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation of capital into more volatile assets."
2024-08-11 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) exhibit strong buy signals based on trend and momentum indicators, while Ethereum (ETH) has recently faced resistance after a significant rally. Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a notable price increase driven by speculative interest, though it remains volatile. Tether (USDT) continues to solidify its position as the leading stablecoin, with recent developments such as the launch of USDT-L on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, the overall bullish momentum and technical indicators support a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity indicate a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative interest is high, the volatility and hype-driven nature of DOGE suggest a cautious approach, with a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-11 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators such as positive momentum and trend signals. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing bullish momentum, with Ethereum recently facing resistance after a significant rally. Solana and Dogecoin are also showing positive momentum, with Dogecoin driven by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether has reached a significant market cap milestone, indicating strong demand for stablecoins, which suggests a mixed risk appetite among investors. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable oil prices, supports a balanced approach to risk allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of significant news, Bitcoin's technical indicators are positive, with strong on-chain activity suggesting continued interest and potential for growth.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum are tempered by resistance levels, but the overall sentiment remains positive, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's consistent positive momentum and normal on-chain activity suggest stability and potential for continued growth, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, its price is heavily influenced by speculative hype, making it a riskier asset. A neutral stance is appropriate given the current market conditions.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive momentum in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capture potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-11 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive trend signals. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing upward price movements, with Ethereum notably rallying significantly before encountering resistance. Solana and Dogecoin are also showing positive price trends, with Dogecoin driven by speculative interest. Tether's market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network indicate strong demand for stablecoins, although the broader market conditions suggest a slight shift towards riskier assets. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderately high volatility index, supports a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows consistent upward momentum and a positive trend signal, though on-chain activity is slightly low. No significant news suggests a stable outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite hitting resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum indicate strong potential for further gains. The breakout above the Bollinger Bands supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's bullish momentum and recent price breakout suggest a favorable environment for continued growth, although no significant news was reported.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's price increase and speculative interest provide a modestly positive outlook, but the hype-driven nature warrants caution.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's market cap milestone is notable, the current market conditions favor a slight rotation into riskier assets, reducing the need for high stablecoin exposure."
2024-08-11 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive price momentum and technical indicators suggesting buy signals. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing upward trends, with Ethereum showing signs of a breakout despite facing resistance. Solana and Dogecoin are also displaying bullish momentum, supported by positive trend signals. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, though the high VIX indicates some caution. Tether's milestone in market capitalization and its expansion into the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance, though it remains a stable asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows consistent upward momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting continued interest and potential for gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's breakout potential and strong technical indicators warrant a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity suggest room for further growth, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has bullish momentum, its price remains speculative and driven by hype, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-11 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and momentum signals. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing bullish momentum, supported by strong trend signals, although Ethereum faces resistance at higher levels. Solana and Dogecoin also exhibit positive momentum, with Solana showing potential for a breakout. Meanwhile, USDT has reached a significant market cap milestone, indicating strong demand for stablecoins, possibly reflecting a hedging strategy amid market volatility. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggests a mixed risk environment, where investors might be balancing between risk-on and risk-off assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows consistent bullish momentum and trend signals, supported by increased on-chain activity. However, the absence of significant news and a mixed macroeconomic backdrop suggest a moderate allocation increase.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite bullish momentum and a recent rally, Ethereum faces resistance, which tempers the allocation score. The market appears cautious about further upside potential.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive technical indicators and potential breakout signal a strong buy opportunity, supported by consistent on-chain activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin exhibits bullish momentum, the price remains driven by speculative hype, with no substantial news to support a strong allocation change.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market showing signs of bullish momentum, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to increase exposure to riskier assets. However, its strong market cap and recent developments on the Lightning Network suggest maintaining a significant stablecoin position."
2024-08-11 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows relatively stable conditions with a moderate level of volatility as indicated by the VIX at 20.6. The crypto market has shown mixed signals over the past few hours, with most assets maintaining bullish momentum despite slight price fluctuations. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to exhibit strong technical signals, although Ethereum is facing resistance at higher levels. Solana and Dogecoin are also showing bullish momentum, but Dogecoin's price remains speculative. Tether's market cap milestone and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network indicate strong demand and innovation in the stablecoin sector.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin maintains bullish momentum with strong technical indicators, but the lack of significant news suggests a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical signals warrant a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, its speculative nature and lack of significant news suggest holding the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals across other assets and Tether's stablecoin dominance, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is appropriate to capitalize on riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a slight bullish bias. Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest a potential buy, but recent price action indicates a possible breakdown. Ethereum has experienced a significant rally, but it is encountering resistance, suggesting caution. Solana's technical indicators remain positive, although its price has slightly decreased. Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative interest, but recent declines suggest caution. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance as a stablecoin, suggesting a safe haven in uncertain conditions. Overall, the macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, supports a cautious yet opportunistic approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price decreases, BTC's technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest potential upward momentum. However, the lack of significant news and recent price breakdown warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's recent rally and resistance at higher levels suggest a neutral stance. The potential for further gains is balanced by the risk of a pullback.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's technical indicators remain positive, but the lack of significant news and slight price decrease suggest a modest allocation increase.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and speculative nature warrant a slight reduction in exposure, especially given the lack of strong supporting news.

USDT: +0.5 — With Tether's growing market cap and integration into the Bitcoin Lightning Network, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven amid mixed market signals."
2024-08-11 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a slight bearish trend, with its price breaking below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Ethereum (ETH) has seen a significant rally but is facing resistance, suggesting caution despite its recent bullish momentum. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are also showing signs of bearish momentum, with both assets experiencing price declines and technical indicators suggesting potential breakdowns. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is maintaining a strong position with a recent market cap milestone and a potential breakout above its upper Bollinger Band, indicating a flight to safety amid increased market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a buy signal from moving averages, the breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band and low on-chain activity suggest potential further downside, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — While ETH has shown recent bullish momentum, the resistance at $2,720 and mixed macroeconomic signals suggest a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — The significant price decrease and breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band indicate bearish sentiment, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite speculative news, DOGE's price action remains bearish with no clear positive momentum, justifying a slight reduction in holdings.

USDT: +0.6 — With increased market volatility and USDT's strong market cap position, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-08-11 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a VIX of 20.6, indicating a cautious but not overly fearful market sentiment. The U.S. Dollar Index is relatively stable, and the S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive risk appetite. In the crypto market, Bitcoin has been experiencing a downward trend with low on-chain activity, while Ethereum shows signs of resistance after a recent rally. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing technical weaknesses, with Solana showing a possible breakdown and Dogecoin driven by speculative news. Tether's market cap milestone and expansion into the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing dominance as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of technical weakness with no significant bullish momentum and low on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and recent rally indicate potential for upward movement, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: -0.1 — Solana's technical indicators suggest a possible breakdown, and without significant news, it remains less attractive compared to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype, but without substantial technical or fundamental support, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market uncertainty and Tether's recent developments, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-11 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate risk with a relatively high VIX at 20.6, indicating increased market volatility. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a bullish sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which might pressure crypto prices. Bitcoin and Solana are experiencing technical breakdowns, with BTC consistently below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Ethereum shows mixed signals with recent resistance at $2,720, while Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype. Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network indicate strong stablecoin demand, suggesting a cautious risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest a bearish trend with price consistently below the lower Bollinger Band and no bullish momentum signals. Given the current portfolio holding, a slight reduction is prudent.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum in previous hours suggest potential for recovery. Maintain a slight positive bias due to its relative strength compared to other assets.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana is showing significant price decreases and technical breakdowns, with no bullish signals. A reduction in exposure is advisable to mitigate potential losses.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative news without substantial technical support. Maintain a neutral stance due to the lack of clear signals and high volatility.

USDT: +0.5 — With increased market volatility and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent for capital preservation and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight to moderate price decreases over the past four hours. Bitcoin and Solana are showing potential breakdown signals, as indicated by their prices falling below the lower Bollinger Bands. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, faces resistance and bearish momentum, while Dogecoin's price remains driven by speculative hype cycles. Tether's market cap milestone and its launch on the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing prominence as a stablecoin. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively high volatility index and stable U.S. dollar index, suggests a mixed risk sentiment, which may prompt investors to maintain a balanced approach between risk assets and stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakdown with low on-chain activity and no significant news to support a bullish case. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the current technicals.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum faces resistance and bearish momentum. The mixed technical signals and lack of strong bullish news warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana is experiencing significant price decreases and potential breakdown signals, with no supportive news. Reducing exposure is advisable to mitigate downside risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype, with no significant changes in data or sentiment. Maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.7 — With the current cautious market sentiment and Tether's growing market cap, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage in uncertain conditions."
2024-08-11 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin and Solana showing signs of potential breakdowns, as indicated by their positions below the lower Bollinger Bands. Ethereum has recently experienced a significant rally but is now facing resistance, suggesting a potential pause or reversal in its upward momentum. Dogecoin's price is largely driven by speculative hype, with discussions about its potential to reach $1. Tether continues to solidify its position as the leading stablecoin, with a significant market cap milestone and recent developments on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Overall, the macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable gold prices, suggests a mixed risk environment, where maintaining some exposure to stable assets like USDT could be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakdown with low on-chain activity and no bullish technical signals. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the current market conditions.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum is facing resistance, and technical indicators do not show strong bullish momentum. Holding the current position is advisable.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana is also below the lower Bollinger Band with no bullish signals, indicating potential weakness. A slight reduction in exposure is recommended.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price is driven by speculative hype, with no significant changes in technical indicators or on-chain activity. Maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — With market uncertainty and Tether's strong market position, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safer allocation in the current environment."
2024-08-11 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar, which can exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing low on-chain activity and is trading below key technical levels, suggesting a lack of bullish momentum. Ethereum has shown some price recovery but faces resistance, with mixed technical signals. Solana and Dogecoin are both experiencing price declines, with Solana showing potential breakdown signals. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap milestone and integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing influence as a stablecoin, offering a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of weakness with low on-chain activity and technical indicators pointing to a lack of bullish momentum. Given the strong dollar and lack of positive news, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's recent price recovery and ongoing buy signals suggest a cautious increase in allocation, especially given its potential for a rebound if resistance levels are overcome.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's significant price decrease and technical breakdown signals warrant a reduction in exposure, as there is no supportive news or data to suggest a reversal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price remains driven by speculative sentiment, with no significant data or news to justify a change in allocation. Holding the current position is advisable.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current market uncertainty and Tether's strong market position, increasing exposure to USDT provides a stable hedge against volatility in other assets."
2024-08-11 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of bearish signals and some stability in the macroeconomic context. Major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE have experienced significant price decreases in the last hour, with technical indicators showing no clear buy signals. On-chain activity for BTC has surged, but this has not translated into positive price momentum. Ethereum's recent rally has faced resistance, and Dogecoin's price remains speculative, driven by hype cycles. Meanwhile, USDT continues to show strength, with a significant market cap milestone and expansion into the Bitcoin Lightning Network, suggesting a preference for stability amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price breakdown and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, despite increased on-chain activity.

ETH: 0.0 — While ETH has faced resistance after a recent rally, the lack of significant bullish indicators and mixed sentiment justifies a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.2 — Price breakdown below Bollinger Bands and no positive momentum signals indicate a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative interest, DOGE lacks strong technical or fundamental support for a directional move, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.5 — Strong market cap growth and stability in the current volatile environment make USDT an attractive asset to hold, increasing exposure slightly."
2024-08-11 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD are not showing bullish signals, and several assets have dipped below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Despite this, USDT has shown strength with bullish momentum signals and a recent milestone in market capitalization, suggesting a flight to safety as investors seek stability amidst volatility. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high VIX and stable U.S. Dollar Index, further supports a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — BTC is experiencing significant price declines and on-chain activity surges without bullish technical signals. Reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for stabilization.

ETH: -0.4 — Despite a recent rally, ETH is facing resistance and bearish momentum, coupled with significant price drops. Reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: -0.5 — SOL is showing signs of a breakdown with significant price decreases and no bullish signals. Reducing exposure to minimize potential losses.

DOGE: -0.2 — DOGE's price is driven by speculative hype, but recent declines and low activity suggest caution. Slightly reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — With market volatility and bearish sentiment, USDT's stability and recent market cap milestone make it an attractive safe haven. Increasing exposure to preserve capital."
2024-08-11 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 20.6. The crypto market has experienced a recent downturn, with significant price decreases across major assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. This suggests a bearish sentiment, with most assets breaking below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. USDT, however, has shown strength, with a recent market cap milestone and positive technical indicators, reflecting its role as a safe haven in times of market uncertainty. The lack of significant news for BTC and SOL, combined with bearish technicals, suggests limited immediate upside potential. Meanwhile, Ethereum's recent rally faced resistance, and Dogecoin remains speculative with no substantial developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, BTC remains under bearish technical signals with no significant news to drive momentum. Maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the current market conditions.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's recent rally faced resistance, and technical indicators remain bearish. The lack of strong bullish catalysts suggests reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and bearish technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position on SOL is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite speculative discussions about reaching $1, DOGE's technical indicators are bearish. Reducing exposure slightly reflects caution in a speculative environment.

USDT: +0.5 — As the market shows bearish tendencies, increasing exposure to USDT is sensible to preserve capital and maintain liquidity, especially with its recent market cap milestone and strong technical indicators."
2024-08-11 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a bearish sentiment, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Technical indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with most assets trading below their short and long-term moving averages. Despite a slight recovery in the last two hours, the overall trend remains negative. On the macroeconomic front, the relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility index (VIX) suggest a cautious risk environment, which typically favors stable assets like USDT. Additionally, USDT's recent milestone in market cap and its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network highlight its growing importance in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite increased on-chain activity, BTC's price remains under pressure with no clear buy signals from technical indicators. The lack of significant news further dampens bullish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's recent rally faced strong resistance, and technical indicators show no bullish momentum. The absence of significant news suggests a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: -0.2 — SOL's price is experiencing a breakdown with no positive technical signals. The lack of supportive news and a bearish market environment justify a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.4 — DOGE's price is driven by speculative hype, but technical indicators are bearish. The absence of substantial news and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.9 — In a bearish market environment, USDT remains attractive due to its stability and recent positive developments, such as its market cap milestone and integration with the Lightning Network."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears to be cautiously bearish, with most major cryptocurrencies experiencing slight declines in price and lacking strong bullish signals. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin are all trading below key technical indicators, suggesting a lack of upward momentum. On-chain activity for Bitcoin shows a recent surge, but this has not translated into price support. Ethereum recently faced resistance after a rally, indicating potential bearish momentum. Dogecoin's price remains speculative, driven by hype cycles, while Tether's USDT has solidified its position as a leading stablecoin, reaching a significant market cap milestone. In this environment, the macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable U.S. dollar index, suggests a cautious approach with potential preference for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent surge in on-chain activity, Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's recent rally faced resistance, and technical indicators remain bearish, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.1 — Solana's technical indicators are bearish, and without significant news or activity spikes, a slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price remains speculative with no significant changes in data or sentiment, justifying a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-08-12 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing notable declines in price over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has faced significant outflows from ETFs, indicating reduced institutional interest, while Ethereum is seeing potential sell-off signals from large holders. Solana, however, shows some technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with no significant news impacting its price. Meanwhile, Tether's involvement in legal disputes does not seem to affect its stability, but the broader market's risk-off sentiment is leading to increased interest in stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Continued ETF outflows and price declines suggest bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off signals from large holders and a recent price dip below key support levels indicate increased downside risk.

SOL: +0.2 — Technical strength from rebounding off the 200-day EMA offers a slight bullish outlook, though broader market conditions remain cautious.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustments.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a defensive position to preserve capital."
2024-08-12 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by broader market dips and specific negative news such as ETF outflows for BTC and potential sell-offs for ETH. Despite these declines, SOL shows signs of technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA. DOGE remains relatively stable without significant news, while USDT maintains its stability amidst legal challenges and educational initiatives. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. Despite some positive news from Marathon Digital, the overall sentiment remains bearish.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant sell-off pressure and potential whale sell-off indicate bearish sentiment. The price is nearing critical support levels.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical rebound from the 200-day EMA suggests potential bullish momentum, making it relatively more attractive in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price movement suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signals for change.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven, especially with ongoing legal assurances of stability."
2024-08-12 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with notable declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has been affected by significant outflows from U.S. BTC ETFs and a general market dip, while Ethereum is facing potential sell-offs from large holders and has dropped below critical support levels. Solana shows some technical strength, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its price. Tether continues to maintain its stability amidst legal challenges and is actively engaging in initiatives to promote blockchain education.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is experiencing ETF outflows and a market dip, indicating bearish sentiment. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under pressure from potential large sell-offs and has broken below key support levels, suggesting a need to reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's bounce off the 200-day EMA indicates technical strength and potential for upward movement, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral position on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and preserves capital."
2024-08-12 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by broader market dips and significant outflows from BTC ETFs. Bitcoin's price has been under pressure, with Marathon Digital's plans to raise funds for more BTC purchases offering some potential support. Ethereum is facing bearish momentum, with significant whale movements suggesting potential sell-offs. Solana shows technical resilience, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating possible bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is maintaining its stability amidst legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows indicate bearish sentiment, though Marathon Digital's interest in acquiring more BTC provides some support. Current holdings suggest a slight reduction.

ETH: -0.4 — Bearish momentum and potential sell-off signals from whale activity suggest reducing exposure to ETH, especially given the proximity to key support levels.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical strength and a bounce off the 200-day EMA suggest some bullish sentiment, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of bearish trends in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a hedge against volatility and potential further declines."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, with significant outflows from ETFs, which suggests a lack of confidence among institutional investors. Ethereum is facing potential sell pressure from whale movements, further contributing to its recent price drop. Solana, however, shows some technical strength by rebounding off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news influence, while Tether maintains its stability amid legal challenges, serving as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent ETF outflows and price declines suggest caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off signals from whale activity and recent price drops indicate a need to reduce exposure further.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical strength from rebounding off the 200-day EMA suggests a potential for upward movement, justifying a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes results in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of bearish sentiment in other assets, increasing USDT holdings provides a stable anchor to manage portfolio risk."
2024-08-12 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed in both Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin's price has been pressured by ETF outflows and broader market declines, while Ethereum faces potential sell-off pressure from a large whale movement. Solana shows some technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, which may indicate renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal issues not affecting its market stability. Given the current macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a stable U.S. dollar, a cautious approach with a preference for stable assets like USDT is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings, the recent ETF outflows and price decline suggest caution in increasing exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential sell-off by a whale and recent price drop below $2,600 indicate bearish sentiment, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — The bounce off the 200-day EMA suggests some technical strength, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in data, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-12 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant price declines over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin's price has been affected by outflows from BTC ETFs, while Ethereum faces potential sell-offs due to large whale movements. Solana shows some technical strength after bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains stable amidst ongoing legal disputes, with no immediate impact on its stability. Given the current macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, a cautious approach with a preference for stable assets is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings, the ETF outflows and recent price decline suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential for a sell-off by a significant whale and the recent price drop below key support levels indicate a need to reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: +0.3 — The technical rebound off the 200-day EMA suggests potential for upward movement, warranting a slight increase in allocation to capture possible gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the current bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-12 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing pressure from ETF outflows, yet there is a potential for increased demand from Marathon Digital's planned purchase. Ethereum is facing potential sell-offs from large holders, contributing to its recent price decline.

BTC: -0.2 — Despite Marathon Digital's planned purchase, ETF outflows and recent price declines suggest caution. Maintaining a slightly reduced exposure is prudent.

ETH: -0.3 — The potential for large sell-offs and recent price declines indicate a need to reduce exposure slightly, as bearish sentiment prevails.

SOL: +0.5 — The technical rebound off the 200-day EMA and bullish momentum signal a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, recent price momentum suggests a modest increase in allocation could be beneficial.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for further volatility, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against downside risks."

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by recent price declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin's recent dip below $58,500, along with significant ETF outflows, suggests a lack of immediate bullish momentum. Ethereum has also experienced a notable sell-off, with potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer. Solana, however, shows some technical strength by rebounding off its 200-day EMA, hinting at potential bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news, and Tether continues to maintain its stability despite legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. However, Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings provide some long-term support.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off pressure from whale movements and recent price declines below $2,600 indicate bearish sentiment.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength from rebounding off the 200-day EMA and bullish momentum signals suggest potential upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with notable declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, both experiencing significant sell-offs. Bitcoin's recent dip below $58,500 is compounded by ETF outflows, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from large whale movements. Solana shows technical resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating some bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news, while Tether maintains its stability amid legal disputes and new partnerships. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high volatility index and stable dollar index, suggests a mixed risk environment, where cautious capital allocation is prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest caution. Despite Marathon Digital's plans to buy more BTC, the short-term sentiment remains bearish.

ETH: -0.2 — The potential for a sell-off due to whale activity and recent price declines suggests maintaining a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength and bullish momentum provide a positive outlook, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes suggests a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies and the need for stability, increasing USDT exposure is prudent to manage risk."
2024-08-12 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, despite recent dips and bearish news. Bitcoin's price is recovering after a dip, but ETF outflows and Marathon Digital's fundraising plans indicate mixed signals. Ethereum faces potential sell-off pressure from a whale movement, but its price has shown resilience above the $2,500 support level. Solana shows technical strength with a bounce off its 200-day EMA, suggesting renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but has shown positive price momentum. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable despite ongoing legal challenges, maintaining its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's plans to increase holdings and recent price recovery suggest moderate bullish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — The potential for a whale sell-off and recent price dip counterbalance the bullish momentum, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and price momentum, along with a bounce off the 200-day EMA, suggest a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Lacking significant news, but recent price increases and bullish momentum warrant a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases with positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."
2024-08-12 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with recent price increases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, indicating a potential bullish trend. However, macroeconomic indicators such as a relatively high U.S. dollar index and volatility index suggest some underlying market caution. Bitcoin has experienced significant ETF outflows, which could dampen its momentum despite recent price gains. Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from large holders, but its technical indicators show bullish momentum. Solana shows technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, while Dogecoin benefits from a general market upswing. Tether remains stable amid legal challenges, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, BTC shows strong upward momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — While facing potential sell pressure from whales, ETH's recent price increase and bullish momentum indicators support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL's rebound off the 200-day EMA and strong bullish momentum make it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Benefiting from the overall market upswing and bullish technical indicators, DOGE shows potential for modest gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive."
2024-08-12 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of bullish momentum across several cryptocurrencies, despite recent price dips.

Ethereum is facing potential sell-off pressure from a whale movement, and its recent price drop indicates bearish sentiment, though technical indicators show some bullish momentum.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings and ongoing bullish momentum suggest moderate confidence in BTC's potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent whale movements and price declines suggest caution, though technical indicators show some bullish momentum. A slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical rebound from the 200-day EMA and consistent bullish momentum make SOL an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, the bullish momentum and slight price increases suggest a modest positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With signs of bullish momentum in other assets, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent declines in BTC and ETH prices despite some bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin has experienced significant outflows from ETFs, indicating potential bearish sentiment, although Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings could provide some support. Ethereum faces potential sell-off pressure from large holders, contributing to its recent price dip. Solana shows technical strength by rebounding off its 200-day EMA, suggesting renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not impacting its market stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and ETF outflows suggest bearish sentiment, despite some bullish technical indicators. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.1 — Potential sell-off pressure from large holders and recent price dips warrant caution, though technicals remain somewhat supportive.

SOL: +0.5 — Rebound off the 200-day EMA and bullish sentiment suggest a positive outlook, making it attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and recent declines in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-12 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with recent price increases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite some recent dips, the market shows signs of recovery, as evidenced by the significant price rebounds in the last hour. Bitcoin's recent price surge, despite ETF outflows, suggests resilience, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from large holders. Solana shows technical strength, bouncing off key moving averages, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. DOGE lacks significant news but follows the general market trend. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with Tether actively defending its position in legal matters and expanding educational initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, BTC shows strong upward momentum and resilience, supported by Marathon Digital's plans to expand holdings.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with potential sell pressure from whale activity, but technical indicators remain bullish. Caution is advised.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical rebound and bullish momentum suggest further upside potential, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive price momentum and alignment with broader market trends, though lacking specific news catalysts.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment improves, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected, favoring riskier assets."
2024-08-12 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with notable volatility across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a dip, coinciding with significant ETF outflows, but there is potential buying interest from Marathon Digital. Ethereum has seen a whale transfer indicating potential sell-off pressure, with technical indicators suggesting a bearish outlook. Solana shows technical strength with a rebound off its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but maintains bullish technical indicators. Tether remains stable despite legal challenges, maintaining its role as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips and ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's interest in accumulating BTC provides a supportive backdrop. The bullish momentum and potential for recovery justify a cautious positive stance.

ETH: -0.1 — The potential sell-off by a whale and bearish technical indicators suggest caution. However, the overall market structure remains intact, warranting only a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — The technical rebound off the 200-day EMA and consistent bullish momentum signals strong potential for upward movement, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral. The lack of major developments suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.4 — As market conditions show signs of potential recovery and risk appetite increases, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-08-12 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders. Despite this, technical indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE remain bullish, with short-term moving averages suggesting buying signals. Solana shows technical strength after rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating potential bullish momentum. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant bullish signals, and its stability is reinforced by Tether's legal and educational initiatives. Overall, the market shows signs of cautious optimism, with potential for upward movement, but recent sell-offs and macroeconomic factors like high volatility and strong USD could temper gains.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, BTC maintains strong technical indicators and bullish momentum, supported by Marathon Digital's plans to increase holdings.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent sell pressure from a whale and a dip below $2,600, but technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting a hold.

SOL: +0.6 — Technical strength is evident with a rebound from the 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment and potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, DOGE maintains bullish technical indicators, suggesting a slight preference for holding or modest accumulation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a stable price and no bullish signals, capital rotation into riskier assets is preferred, reducing USDT exposure in favor of potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, influenced by substantial outflows from BTC ETFs, while Ethereum is under pressure from potential sell-offs by large holders. Despite these declines, technical indicators for assets like Solana suggest some underlying bullish strength, as it recently bounced off a key moving average. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability over aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent ETF outflows and price dip suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — The potential for a significant sell-off by a whale and the recent price decline warrant a reduction in exposure to mitigate downside risk.

SOL: +0.2 — Technical strength indicated by the bounce off the 200-day EMA suggests a modest increase in allocation, despite the broader market downturn.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or major changes in data, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, increasing exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity in the current market environment."
2024-08-12 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, which have seen significant price drops and ETF outflows. Bitcoin is experiencing a dip, exacerbated by ETF outflows, while Ethereum faces potential sell pressure from a whale movement and fading bullish momentum. Solana shows technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, suggesting some renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. Tether is actively engaging in legal and educational initiatives, maintaining its stability amid broader market uncertainties. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high VIX and stable USD, suggests a cautious risk environment, favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, significant ETF outflows and recent price declines suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Recent whale activity and a notable price drop indicate potential further downside. Reducing exposure is prudent given the bearish news.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength from rebounding off the 200-day EMA and consistent bullish momentum warrant an increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintaining current holdings is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against further market declines."
2024-08-12 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bearish, with notable declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced significant outflows from ETFs, indicating reduced institutional interest, while Ethereum faces potential sell-off pressure from large holders. Despite these challenges, Solana shows technical resilience, bouncing off its 200-day EMA, suggesting some underlying bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, and Tether continues to maintain its stability amid legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, significant ETF outflows and recent price declines suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Potential sell-off by large holders and recent price drops indicate bearish sentiment. Reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: +0.3 — Technical strength and resilience at the 200-day EMA provide a positive outlook, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-08-12 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall crypto market is experiencing a mixed sentiment with recent declines in major assets like BTC and ETH, driven by significant outflows and bearish news. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, with ETF outflows contributing to its recent dip, although Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings could provide some support. Ethereum is facing potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer, with technical indicators pointing to weakening bullish momentum. Solana shows signs of technical strength, rebounding off its 200-day EMA, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news. Tether continues to maintain stability despite legal challenges, emphasizing its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines and ETF outflows, Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings provide a supportive backdrop, and technical indicators remain bullish.

ETH: -0.3 — The potential sell-off from a large whale and recent price drop below $2,600 suggest caution, with bearish sentiment and technical indicators pointing to further downside risk.

SOL: +0.5 — Technical strength is evident with a rebound off the 200-day EMA, suggesting renewed bullish sentiment and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains stable and neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential volatility, maintaining some exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent, although no significant capital rotation is warranted at this time."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced recent price dips, influenced by ETF outflows and whale movements, respectively. However, technical indicators for Bitcoin remain positive, with short-term moving averages and momentum signals suggesting potential upward movement. Solana shows technical strength, rebounding from its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin maintains a stable outlook with no significant news impacting its trajectory. Tether remains stable amidst legal challenges, with no immediate threat to its peg. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable gold and oil prices, suggests a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows, technical indicators and Marathon Digital's expansion plans support a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent whale movements and price dips suggest potential sell-offs, warranting a cautious approach despite underlying bullish technicals.

SOL: +0.6 — Rebound from the 200-day EMA and positive technical signals indicate strong potential for upward movement, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Stable technical indicators and lack of significant news suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the slight bullish tilt in other assets, a moderate reduction in USDT allocation is warranted to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."
2024-08-12 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery from recent declines. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced slight price increases over the past few hours, despite recent dips and negative news regarding ETF outflows and potential sell-offs by large holders. Solana has shown technical strength by bouncing off its 200-day EMA, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin has seen price increases without significant news, suggesting speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal challenges not affecting its market position. Overall, the market appears to be in a recovery phase, with bullish signals emerging for several assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain bullish, and Marathon Digital's plans to increase BTC holdings are supportive of upward momentum.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing potential sell pressure from a whale, Ethereum's technical indicators are still bullish. However, caution is warranted due to the recent price dip and bearish news.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bounce off the 200-day EMA and positive technical signals suggest strong bullish sentiment, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — With no significant news but positive price momentum, Dogecoin appears to be benefiting from speculative interest, warranting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — As market conditions improve, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reflecting increased risk appetite."
2024-08-13 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals, particularly for BTC and ETH, driven by strong technical indicators and momentum. However, there is caution due to potential sell pressure, as highlighted by recent news about BTC's possible $5K decline and significant USDT outflows from exchanges, which could signal a risk-off sentiment. Ethereum's growing staking rate provides a positive outlook, suggesting institutional interest. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains stable without significant news. The macroeconomic backdrop, with moderate volatility and stable indices, supports a cautious but slightly optimistic stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite strong technical indicators and momentum, news of potential sell pressure and Mt. Gox distribution warrants caution. Maintain a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong technical signals and positive news on staking rates provide a bullish outlook. Institutional interest in staking adds confidence.

SOL: +0.2 — Modest gains and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest a slight positive bias, though technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators justify a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Large outflows from exchanges may indicate a shift towards risk assets, suggesting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-13 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.12. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows bullish momentum, but there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to Mt. Gox-related developments and analyst warnings of a possible price drop. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking asset, with new benchmarks being introduced, which could enhance its appeal as a ""risk-free"" rate alternative. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin lacks significant news. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, which could impact Bitcoin negatively.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite bullish momentum, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox distributions and analyst warnings of a price drop warrant caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

**ETH: +0.5** — Positive developments in staking and institutional interest provide a favorable outlook. The asset is gaining traction as a reliable yield alternative, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

**SOL: +0.3** — Solana's modest gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate a positive trend. While not as strong as Ethereum, it deserves a slight increase in allocation.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news or changes in sentiment, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

**USDT: -0.2** — The large outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential move towards risk assets, but caution is warranted given the mixed signals in the broader market. A slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-08-13 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Despite bullish momentum signals, Bitcoin faces potential downside risks as analysts warn of a possible $5K drop amid seller dominance. Ethereum's staking developments are positive, but the recent price decrease suggests caution. Solana shows relative strength, posting modest gains and leading the CoinDesk-20 index. Meanwhile, DOGE lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. The stablecoin market indicates reduced selling pressure on BTC, but the substantial outflow of USDT from exchanges signals a potential risk-off environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum, warnings of a potential $5K drop and Mt. Gox-related uncertainties suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — Positive developments in staking are offset by recent price declines. Maintain current exposure as the market digests new staking benchmarks.

SOL: +0.5 — Relative strength and positive price action make SOL attractive, especially as it leads the CoinDesk-20 index. Increase exposure moderately.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed price action suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.3 — The significant outflow from exchanges and potential risk-off signals warrant a slight increase in stablecoin holdings to hedge against volatility."
2024-08-13 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed with some bullish signals in technical indicators for several cryptocurrencies, but also notable caution due to macroeconomic factors and news. Bitcoin shows strong on-chain activity and technical momentum, yet faces potential downside risks from news about Mt. Gox payouts and analyst warnings of a price drop. Ethereum is buoyed by growing institutional interest in staking, which is being positioned as a benchmark rate, although recent price movements have been volatile. Solana has shown modest gains and positive momentum, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or changes in sentiment. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off environment, with reduced selling pressure on Bitcoin but also signaling caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite strong on-chain activity and bullish technicals, news of potential sell pressure and Mt. Gox payouts tempers enthusiasm. Maintain moderate exposure while monitoring developments.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest in staking and positive momentum signals support a favorable outlook, though recent price volatility suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and recent gains in the broader index make Solana attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in technical indicators suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.2 — Large outflows from exchanges and reduced selling pressure on BTC indicate a slight shift away from stablecoins, though maintaining some exposure for risk management is prudent."
2024-08-13 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off environment, warranting a slight increase in stablecoin holdings for safety."
2024-08-13 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin shows strong on-chain activity and bullish technical indicators, but news of potential sell pressure and Mt. Gox payouts could introduce volatility. Ethereum's staking developments are positive, but technical signals remain mixed. Solana is showing modest gains and positive momentum, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum. USDT outflows suggest reduced selling pressure on BTC, but also indicate a potential risk-off sentiment as capital exits exchanges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators and strong on-chain activity, news of potential sell pressure and Mt. Gox payouts warrant caution. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.1 — Positive developments in staking as a benchmark rate are offset by mixed technical signals. Slightly increase exposure due to potential long-term benefits.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong momentum and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index support increased allocation. Positive sentiment and technicals suggest further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges and reduced selling pressure on BTC suggest a shift towards risk assets. Reduce exposure to stablecoins in favor of more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Solana showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin's on-chain activity is surging, and despite concerns about potential sell pressure from the Mt. Gox wallet, the overall trend remains positive. Ethereum is experiencing increased interest in staking, which is being viewed as a stable yield alternative, though its technical indicators are mixed. Solana is leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, suggesting strong market interest. Dogecoin remains relatively unchanged with no significant news, while Tether's large outflows from exchanges could indicate a shift towards risk-off sentiment, potentially impacting Bitcoin negatively.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox, Bitcoin's strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook, though caution is warranted.

ETH: +0.2 — Increased interest in staking and institutional traction provide a supportive backdrop, but mixed technicals suggest a moderate allocation increase.

SOL: +0.6 — Leading gains in the broader market index and positive momentum signal a strong buy preference.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate a potential risk-off sentiment, but maintaining some exposure as a hedge against volatility is prudent."
2024-08-13 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and a stable U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin (BTC) faces potential downward pressure due to sell signals and the looming Mt. Gox payout, which could increase supply. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, though its technical indicators are neutral. Solana (SOL) is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks significant news or momentum. Tether (USDT) has seen substantial outflows from exchanges, suggesting a potential risk-off sentiment and reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum, the potential for a $5K drop due to sell pressure and Mt. Gox distribution warrants caution. Holding current position with a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are neutral, the growing adoption of ETH staking as a benchmark rate provides a positive long-term outlook. Slight increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest a favorable environment for SOL. Increasing exposure to capitalize on upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.3 — Despite outflows, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a hedge against potential market downturns, especially with bearish signals in BTC."
2024-08-13 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin is experiencing seller dominance, with potential downward pressure indicated by news of a possible $5K drop and the Mt. Gox payout, which could increase supply. Ethereum shows growth in staking as a benchmark rate, suggesting institutional interest, but technical indicators remain mixed. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating relative strength. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. USDT's large outflow from exchanges suggests a risk-off environment, potentially signaling a bearish outlook for BTC and other risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some bullish technicals, significant sell pressure and potential Mt. Gox distribution pose downside risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Institutional interest in staking provides a positive long-term outlook, but short-term technicals are neutral.

SOL: +0.3 — Leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index and maintaining bullish momentum, suggesting relative strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a preference for stability amid potential market downturns."
2024-08-13 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.12. However, the crypto market is experiencing a slight bearish trend, with most assets showing minor price declines over the past hours. Bitcoin faces potential sell pressure, as highlighted by analyst warnings and the Mt. Gox payout developments, which could lead to increased volatility. Ethereum's staking developments are positive, but the asset still lacks strong bullish signals. Solana shows some resilience, leading the CoinDesk-20 index with modest gains. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a risk-off sentiment, potentially indicating a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The potential for a significant price drop due to sell pressure and the Mt. Gox payout news suggests caution. Current holdings should be reduced to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite positive staking developments, technical indicators remain neutral, with no clear bullish momentum. Maintaining current exposure is prudent.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's modest gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index provide a slight bullish signal, warranting a minor increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the potential for increased market volatility and risk-off sentiment, a slight increase in stablecoin holdings is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is facing potential downward pressure due to increased sell signals and concerns over the Mt. Gox payout, which could introduce significant BTC supply into the market. Ethereum, on the other hand, is seeing growing interest in staking as a benchmark rate, which could provide some stability. Solana is showing modest gains, indicating some positive momentum within the CoinDesk-20 index. Dogecoin lacks significant news, suggesting a neutral stance. Meanwhile, the large outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, as investors may be preparing for a downturn in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The potential for a significant price drop due to sell pressure and the Mt. Gox distribution poses a risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite sideways technicals, the growing interest in staking as a benchmark rate provides a slight positive outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive momentum and recent gains within the CoinDesk-20 index suggest a favorable environment for Solana, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the potential risk-off sentiment and large outflows from exchanges, increasing USDT holdings as a defensive measure is prudent."
2024-08-13 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin faces potential downside pressure due to seller dominance and the looming Mt. Gox payout, which could introduce additional selling pressure. Ethereum shows a growing institutional interest in staking, positioning it as a potential ""risk-free"" yield alternative. Solana has experienced modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, suggesting some positive momentum. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, the significant outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a risk-off sentiment, potentially indicating a shift towards holding more stable assets like USDT amidst uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Concerns about potential sell-offs from Mt. Gox payouts and analyst warnings of a $5K drop suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite sideways technicals, the growing interest in staking as a benchmark rate provides a positive outlook. Maintain current holdings with a slight preference for increase.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price movement and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate stronger momentum. Increase exposure to capitalize on potential gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintain current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.3 — The large outflow from exchanges and potential risk-off sentiment suggest holding more USDT as a precautionary measure against market volatility."
2024-08-13 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight upward price movements over the past few hours. Bitcoin is experiencing increased on-chain activity, but faces potential sell pressure due to Mt. Gox-related news and analyst warnings of a possible price drop. Ethereum is gaining attention as a staking benchmark, which could attract more institutional interest. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news. The large outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating reduced selling pressure on BTC but also signaling caution in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases and on-chain activity, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox news and analyst warnings suggests caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: +0.2 — Growing interest in Ethereum staking as a benchmark rate is positive, but technical indicators remain neutral. Slightly increase exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price movement and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest continued strength. Increase exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — While there is a large outflow from exchanges, indicating potential risk-off sentiment, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given market uncertainties. Slightly increase exposure."
2024-08-13 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a slight bullish inclination. Bitcoin (BTC) has shown some positive momentum in recent hours, but there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout and analyst warnings of a possible $5K drop. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which could bolster its appeal to institutional investors. Solana (SOL) is leading minor gains in the broader market, indicating some investor confidence. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its outlook. Tether (USDT) has seen a significant outflow from exchanges, which might suggest a risk-off sentiment, but it also aligns with reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite potential sell pressure, recent positive momentum and on-chain activity suggest a cautious increase in allocation, but the Mt. Gox news warrants a conservative approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Growing institutional interest in staking and the introduction of a new staking benchmark are positive for ETH, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Leading gains in the market and positive technical signals support a stronger allocation to SOL, reflecting its relative strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE is prudent.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT outflows suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, the reduced selling pressure on BTC indicates a slight decrease in USDT allocation as capital rotates into other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with some mixed signals. Bitcoin is experiencing sell pressure, potentially leading to a significant price drop, as indicated by analysts. However, on-chain activity shows a surge in transactions, suggesting some underlying interest. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking alternative, with new benchmarks being introduced, but its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana is showing positive momentum, leading gains in the broader market index. Dogecoin lacks significant news or changes, maintaining a stable position. Meanwhile, Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating reduced selling pressure on Bitcoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish on-chain activity, the potential for a significant price drop and recent sell pressure warrants caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and neutral news impact suggest holding current positions without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price momentum and leading market performance make Solana an attractive asset to increase exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in technical indicators suggests maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.2 — While large outflows indicate a potential risk-off sentiment, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent in light of mixed signals across other assets."
2024-08-13 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant price increases observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and SOL in the last hour. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, breaking out of its Bollinger Bands, although there is a looming risk of a $5K drop due to potential sell pressure. Ethereum's staking developments are gaining traction, suggesting institutional confidence. Solana is leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating positive momentum. Meanwhile, DOGE lacks significant news but has shown a notable price increase. The substantial outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, which could indicate a shift towards accumulating riskier assets like BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the potential for a $5K drop, BTC's recent breakout and bullish momentum suggest an opportunity for gains. However, caution is warranted due to the news of possible sell pressure.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's staking developments and recent price surge indicate growing institutional interest, though technicals remain somewhat mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong performance and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index, combined with bullish technical indicators, make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE has experienced a price increase, the lack of significant news or technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — The large outflow from exchanges and reduced selling pressure on BTC indicate a potential shift away from stablecoins, suggesting a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-13 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has shown strong bullish momentum, although there are concerns about potential sell pressure due to the Mt. Gox payout. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking benchmark, which is positive for institutional interest. Solana is leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating strong market interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its sentiment. The substantial outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, indicating a possible shift in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox, Bitcoin's strong momentum and on-chain activity suggest continued interest. However, caution is warranted due to the news of potential sell-offs.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's growing role as a staking benchmark and positive momentum support a moderate buy signal, although technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong performance and positive momentum make it an attractive option, especially as it leads gains in the broader index.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold.

USDT: -0.3 — The significant outflow from exchanges indicates a shift away from stablecoins, suggesting a moderate reduction in USDT holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-13 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing some sell pressure, with potential for a significant price drop due to Mt. Gox-related distribution concerns. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking alternative, with institutional interest in its staking yield. Solana is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news.

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the potential for a significant price drop due to Mt. Gox-related sell pressure and large USDT outflows suggests caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Increasing institutional interest in staking and positive momentum signals support a modest allocation increase.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price action and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — While large outflows suggest a risk-off sentiment, maintaining some stablecoin exposure provides a hedge against potential market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced significant price increases and on-chain activity, although there are warnings of potential sell-offs due to Mt. Gox-related developments. Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as a staking alternative, with institutional interest growing, which supports its bullish outlook. Solana (SOL) is leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index, indicating positive momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its price. Tether (USDT) has seen a substantial outflow from exchanges, suggesting a potential risk-off sentiment as investors might be reallocating capital into other cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential sell-off warnings, BTC's strong upward momentum and on-chain activity suggest continued interest and accumulation, warranting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Growing institutional interest in Ethereum staking and positive technical indicators support a favorable outlook, making ETH an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — SOL's consistent positive performance and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index, along with bullish technical indicators, justify a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral, warranting a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — The large outflow of USDT from exchanges suggests a shift towards riskier assets, indicating a reduced need for stablecoin holdings in the current market environment."
2024-08-13 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability, with the U.S. Dollar Index at 102.56 and the S&P 500 at 5434.43, indicating a relatively stable financial backdrop. However, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) at 18.12 suggests some market uncertainty. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows bullish technical indicators but faces potential downside risks due to sell pressure and the Mt. Gox distribution. Ethereum's staking developments are positive, suggesting institutional interest. Solana is showing modest gains, while Dogecoin lacks significant news. The large outflow of USDT from exchanges may indicate a risk-off sentiment, potentially leading to a BTC downtrend.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technicals, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox and analyst warnings of a $5K drop create downside risk. Maintain a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive developments in staking as a benchmark rate and institutional interest provide a strong foundation for growth, despite minor price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.3 — Modest gains and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index suggest a positive outlook, though the recent price decrease warrants cautious optimism.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite the recent outflows, the potential for increased BTC accumulation suggests maintaining a balanced position in stablecoins to hedge against volatility."
2024-08-13 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and positive trend indicators. Bitcoin, despite experiencing some sell pressure, maintains a bullish technical outlook, though news of potential sell-offs from Mt. Gox creditors introduces uncertainty. Ethereum's increasing staking activity and new benchmark rate suggest growing institutional interest, bolstering its appeal. Solana is showing modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains stable without significant news. The stablecoin USDT is experiencing significant outflows, which could signal a risk-off sentiment or reduced selling pressure on BTC.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the potential for a $5K drop due to sell pressure, the overall technical indicators remain bullish, and on-chain activity is strong. However, caution is warranted due to the Mt. Gox news.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional interest in staking and positive momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook. The introduction of a new staking benchmark further supports Ethereum's attractiveness.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive price movement and leading performance in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate a favorable environment for Solana, supported by consistent on-chain activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral, warranting a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest a potential shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need to hold a large stablecoin position in the current environment."
2024-08-13 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators, such as buy signals from moving averages and positive momentum from MACD. However, macroeconomic factors like a relatively high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices suggest a mixed environment for risk assets. Bitcoin faces potential downside risk due to sell pressure and the Mt. Gox distribution, while Ethereum benefits from increased staking activity, potentially positioning it as a stable yield alternative. Solana shows modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains stable without significant news. Tether's large outflow from exchanges could indicate a risk-off sentiment, suggesting caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox and analyst warnings of a $5K drop warrant caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional interest in staking and the introduction of a new staking benchmark support Ethereum's appeal as a yield-generating asset. This makes ETH relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's modest gains and leadership in the CoinDesk-20 index indicate positive momentum, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current position is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — The large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential shift towards risk assets, indicating a reduced need for holding stablecoins in the portfolio."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with the 10-Year Treasury Yield at 3.85% and the S&P 500 Index at 5434.43, indicating a relatively stable financial market. However, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) at 18.12 suggests some market uncertainty. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is facing potential downward pressure due to seller dominance and the impending Mt. Gox payout, which could lead to increased volatility. Ethereum is gaining traction as a staking alternative, with new benchmarks being introduced, indicating growing institutional interest. Solana has shown modest gains, leading the CoinDesk-20 index, while Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news. Tether's large outflow from exchanges suggests a potential risk-off sentiment, possibly indicating a shift towards more stable assets or a precursor to a BTC downtrend.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the potential $5K drop and Mt. Gox payout create significant downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.3 — Institutional interest in staking and new benchmarks provide a positive outlook, though recent price fluctuations warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.5 — Leading gains in the CoinDesk-20 index and consistent technical strength make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.2 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a risk-off sentiment, but maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent given potential market volatility."
2024-08-14 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a relatively strong S&P 500 index. The crypto market is experiencing bullish momentum across major assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, supported by technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD signals. Bitcoin is seeing increased institutional interest with significant investments in spot-Bitcoin ETFs, while Ethereum faces a shift toward inflationary supply but has positive developments with upcoming network upgrades. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, suggesting strong network usage, although its price direction remains uncertain. Tether's recent large withdrawals and minting activities indicate significant liquidity movements, reflecting investor caution and potential shifts in market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The potential bottoming event due to miner capitulation also supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming network upgrade and continued bullish momentum provide a moderately positive signal for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.5 — High on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout, along with strong technical signals, make Solana an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and consistent low on-chain activity, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — The large outflows from exchanges and increased market liquidity suggest a rotation out of stablecoins, indicating a slight reduction in USDT holdings as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-14 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows strong institutional interest with major banks increasing their positions in Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting growing confidence in the asset. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades indicate mixed sentiment but potential long-term growth. Solana's network activity is at record highs, indicating robust usage and potential for price appreciation. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent outflows from exchanges and increased minting on Ethereum suggest shifts in liquidity, possibly indicating a move towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and bullish momentum indicators suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin. The potential bottoming event with miner capitulation adds to the positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum faces inflationary pressures, the upcoming Pectra fork and continued developer interest provide a positive long-term outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Record on-chain activity and the potential for a bullish breakout make Solana an attractive asset, especially given its recent price support levels.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral, warranting no change in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — The large outflows from exchanges and increased minting suggest a rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-14 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by institutional interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs and potential miner capitulation signaling a price bottom. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals with a shift toward inflationary supply, yet upcoming developer-friendly changes could boost its appeal. Solana's network activity is at record highs, indicating strong engagement, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity, although recent minting indicates continued demand and market liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and potential miner capitulation suggest a bullish outlook, supported by positive technical indicators and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.3 — While facing inflationary pressure, the upcoming Pectra fork could enhance its long-term value proposition, maintaining a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout support a positive outlook, despite mixed price sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings in a cautiously bullish environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong institutional interest through significant investments in Bitcoin ETFs by major banks. This, coupled with miner capitulation, suggests a potential bottoming event for BTC. Ethereum's shift towards an inflationary supply due to reduced network activity presents mixed signals, though upcoming technical upgrades could provide future support. Solana's network activity is at record highs, indicating strong underlying demand, but price action remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and subsequent minting on Ethereum indicate liquidity shifts, possibly reflecting a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investments and miner capitulation suggest strong support and potential for upward movement, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the upcoming technical upgrades and consistent buy signals provide a slightly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout support a moderate positive allocation, despite mixed price signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted."
2024-08-14 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility (VIX at 16.19) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing strong technical indicators with buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum, supported by significant institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum's shift to inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades may influence its price dynamics. Solana's on-chain activity is at record levels, indicating strong network usage, although its price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, while Tether's large outflows from exchanges and new minting on Ethereum suggest shifts in liquidity and investor positioning.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and positive technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. The miner capitulation news could indicate a price bottom, enhancing its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, the bullish technical indicators and upcoming network upgrades provide a positive outlook. However, the inflationary aspect tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.3 — High on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout provide a positive outlook, although mixed sentiment and uncertain price direction warrant caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance, with no clear catalyst for movement.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges and increased minting suggest a rotation out of stablecoins, as investors may be seeking higher returns in other assets."
2024-08-14 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing signs of institutional interest through ETF investments, which could bolster confidence and support prices. Ethereum is facing a shift towards inflationary supply, which may dampen bullish sentiment despite upcoming technical upgrades. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, suggesting strong network usage, although price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, while Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity preferences, possibly indicating a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest potential for upward movement. The technical indicators also support a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.1 — While Ethereum is facing inflationary pressure, the upcoming technical upgrades could provide some support. However, the overall sentiment remains mixed.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout provide a positive outlook, though price direction remains uncertain.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a potential shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-14 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing increased institutional interest through significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks. This, coupled with miner capitulation, suggests a potential bottoming event for BTC. Ethereum is facing mixed signals with a shift towards inflationary supply, although upcoming network upgrades may provide future bullish catalysts. Solana's network activity is robust, indicating strong usage, but its price remains in a consolidation phase with potential for both upward and downward movement. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's substantial outflows from exchanges and increased minting on Ethereum indicate shifting liquidity dynamics, possibly reflecting a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investments and miner capitulation suggest strong support and potential for price appreciation, making BTC a preferred asset.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite inflationary supply concerns, the upcoming Pectra fork and continued bullish momentum in technical indicators justify a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout support a favorable allocation, despite current price consolidation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes results in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure without adjustments.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in other assets and significant outflows from exchanges, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of risk assets is advisable."
2024-08-14 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. The S&P 500 is relatively high, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is seeing institutional interest with major banks investing in spot ETFs, which could signal confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum is experiencing a shift towards inflationary supply, which might dampen its appeal slightly. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, indicating strong network usage, although its price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent large outflows and minting activities suggest liquidity shifts, which could impact market stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest a potential price bottom, making BTC attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift towards inflationary supply, Ethereum's upcoming technical upgrades and continued bullish momentum signal a moderate buy.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout make Solana appealing, though price direction remains uncertain.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the risk-on sentiment and Tether's recent outflows, reducing exposure to stablecoins in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-08-14 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 index. The crypto market shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin experiencing institutional interest through ETF investments, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Ethereum's shift to an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades present a mixed outlook. Solana's network activity is robust, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges indicate a shift in liquidity, possibly signaling a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and potential bottoming signals from miner activity suggest a positive outlook, despite mixed technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and upcoming technical upgrades provide a positive outlook, although the shift to inflationary supply tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential technical upgrades support a positive allocation, despite uncertain price direction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges and a potential increase in risk appetite suggest a reduced allocation to stablecoins."
2024-08-14 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish signals and some cautionary notes. Bitcoin is seeing institutional interest with major banks increasing their ETF positions, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. Ethereum is experiencing a shift towards inflationary supply, but upcoming technical upgrades may bolster its appeal. Solana is witnessing record on-chain activity, indicating strong network usage, though its price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity, possibly indicating a move towards riskier assets or a precautionary stance by investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and miner activity suggest a potential bottoming, combined with positive technical signals, support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the shift to inflationary supply, bullish momentum and upcoming upgrades provide a positive outlook, though tempered by supply concerns.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and technical signals indicate potential for upward movement, supported by network upgrades.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — Large outflows from exchanges and positive sentiment in other assets suggest a rotation out of stablecoins towards riskier assets."
2024-08-14 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some signs of potential recovery in certain assets. Bitcoin's recent price drop, despite institutional interest from major banks, suggests a cautious outlook, although miner capitulation could indicate a price bottom. Ethereum is experiencing a shift towards inflationary supply, which might dampen its appeal, but upcoming technical upgrades could provide a longer-term boost. Solana is showing strong on-chain activity and technical patterns that suggest potential for significant price movement, either upward or downward. Dogecoin lacks significant news and continues to show weak technical signals. Tether's large outflows from exchanges indicate a shift in liquidity, but the minting of new USDT suggests ongoing demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, institutional interest and miner capitulation suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to current technical weakness.

ETH: +0.1 — Mixed signals with inflationary concerns, but upcoming technical upgrades and consistent bullish momentum provide some support.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout make Solana relatively attractive, especially given its recent price resilience.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and weak technical indicators suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite outflows from exchanges, the minting of new USDT indicates continued demand, suggesting a slight preference for maintaining stablecoin exposure in a mixed market environment."
2024-08-14 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies, with some assets experiencing recent declines while others maintain bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin is seeing institutional interest with significant investments in spot ETFs, suggesting growing confidence despite recent price declines and miner capitulation. Ethereum is transitioning towards an inflationary supply, which may dampen its attractiveness, though upcoming technical upgrades could provide support. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, indicating strong network usage, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and new minting on Ethereum highlight liquidity shifts, possibly indicating a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest potential for a price bottom, despite recent price declines.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply concerns offset by upcoming technical upgrades; maintain current exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a breakout, supported by technical indicators, make it relatively attractive.

DOGE: -0.1 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest a slight reduction in exposure, but maintain a mostly neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite large outflows, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent given the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility."
2024-08-14 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest potential for price recovery, though recent price breakdowns warrant cautious optimism.

**ETH: 0.0** — The shift to inflationary supply and mixed technical signals balance out the potential positive impact of upcoming network upgrades, resulting in a neutral stance.

**SOL: +0.6** — Strong on-chain activity and technical signals suggest potential for upward movement, making it relatively attractive in the current market environment.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest no strong directional bias, warranting a hold position.

**USDT: -0.3** — Large outflows from exchanges and increased minting indicate a shift in liquidity, suggesting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings as risk appetite may be increasing."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. The S&P 500 is performing well, which could signal a risk-on sentiment in broader markets. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin shows signs of potential bottoming with institutional interest in ETFs, yet technical indicators suggest a bearish trend with price below the lower Bollinger Band. Ethereum's shift to an inflationary supply and lack of strong bullish signals indicate caution. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, suggesting potential for growth, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news and shows no strong technical signals. Tether's large outflows and minting indicate liquidity shifts, possibly signaling a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest potential for price recovery, despite current bearish technical indicators.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply concerns and lack of bullish momentum, balanced by upcoming technological upgrades.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout, supported by network upgrades, make it relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or technical momentum to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Despite recent outflows, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given the uncertain market conditions, but reducing slightly to allocate towards more promising assets."
2024-08-14 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. The U.S. Dollar Index remains steady, and gold prices are elevated, suggesting a cautious but not overly risk-averse market sentiment. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is experiencing institutional interest with major banks increasing their ETF positions, although miner capitulation suggests potential bottoming. Ethereum is facing inflationary pressures but has upcoming technological upgrades. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and potential for price movement, while Dogecoin lacks significant news. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest liquidity shifts, possibly indicating a cautious stance among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs and miner capitulation suggest a potential bottoming, making BTC relatively attractive despite recent price weakness.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply pressures and upcoming technological upgrades. The market seems undecided, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout make SOL appealing, especially given its recent price support levels.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest no immediate action is needed for DOGE.

USDT: -0.3 — With large outflows from exchanges, there is a slight preference to reduce USDT holdings in favor of more volatile assets, reflecting a moderate risk appetite."
2024-08-14 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable S&P 500 and a relatively low VIX, indicating a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin's recent institutional interest, as evidenced by significant investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs by major banks, suggests growing confidence in its long-term potential. However, miner capitulation and high on-chain activity hint at potential short-term volatility. Ethereum's shift towards an inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades present mixed signals, with potential long-term benefits but short-term uncertainties. Solana's robust on-chain activity and technical indicators suggest potential for upward movement, though the market remains cautious. Tether's large outflows from exchanges and increased minting on Ethereum indicate significant liquidity shifts, reflecting a defensive stance among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and potential bottoming signals from miner activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, though short-term volatility remains a risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from inflationary supply concerns and upcoming technical upgrades lead to a neutral stance, awaiting clearer direction.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and technical indicators support a positive outlook, with potential for price appreciation if bullish patterns confirm.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding current positions without adjustment.

USDT: -0.3 — Despite recent liquidity shifts, the overall market sentiment suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets."
2024-08-14 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.19. However, the crypto market shows signs of bearish sentiment, with most assets experiencing slight price decreases and technical indicators not signaling strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin's recent miner capitulation could suggest a potential bottoming, while institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs indicates growing confidence. Ethereum's shift toward inflationary supply and the upcoming Pectra fork add complexity to its outlook. Solana's on-chain activity remains robust, hinting at potential growth, though price direction is uncertain. Tether's significant outflows and minting activities suggest liquidity shifts, possibly reflecting a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and potential bottoming signals from miner activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, despite current bearish technical indicators.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with inflationary supply concerns balanced by upcoming technical upgrades. Neutral position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a bullish breakout, though current price direction remains uncertain. Maintain moderate exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest holding the current position without changes.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite recent outflows, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent given the overall cautious market sentiment and potential for increased volatility."
2024-08-14 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed backdrop for cryptocurrencies, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility. The U.S. dollar index remains relatively stable, while gold prices are high, indicating a potential flight to safety. In the crypto market, Bitcoin's recent ETF-related news suggests growing institutional interest, which could provide a positive sentiment boost. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply may weigh on its attractiveness, while Solana's record on-chain activity and potential technical breakout offer a promising outlook. Dogecoin lacks significant news, indicating a neutral stance. Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity dynamics, possibly indicating a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and potential miner capitulation suggest a positive outlook, despite current technical indicators not signaling a strong buy.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum's shift to inflationary supply and lack of strong technical signals suggest caution, though upcoming network upgrades could provide future support.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout make Solana relatively attractive, despite mixed sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite large outflows, maintaining some USDT exposure provides a hedge against potential market volatility, especially given the mixed signals across other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautious with no clear bullish or bearish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent news of institutional interest through spot-ETF investments suggests growing confidence, though miner capitulation indicates potential price bottoming. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply and upcoming technical upgrades present mixed signals. Solana shows strong on-chain activity, hinting at potential bullish momentum, but price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether's large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift in liquidity, possibly indicating a cautious market sentiment with a preference for holding stable assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs is a positive sign, suggesting potential for upward movement. However, miner capitulation indicates caution, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — The shift towards inflationary supply and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance. Upcoming upgrades could provide future bullish momentum, but current conditions are stable.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential technical upgrades provide a positive outlook. However, mixed sentiment on price direction warrants a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without adjustments.

USDT: -0.2 — Large outflows from exchanges indicate a cautious market with potential capital rotation into riskier assets. However, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given the overall market uncertainty."
2024-08-14 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with no strong technical buy signals across major assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is seeing institutional interest through spot-ETF investments, which could be a positive long-term signal. Ethereum is facing a shift towards inflationary supply, which may weigh on its price. Solana's on-chain activity is robust, indicating potential for future growth, although price direction remains uncertain. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether is experiencing large outflows, suggesting a shift in liquidity preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest in Bitcoin through ETF investments suggests potential for long-term growth, despite current technical indicators showing no strong buy signals.

ETH: -0.1 — The shift towards an inflationary supply could dampen price prospects, although upcoming technical upgrades may provide future support.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong on-chain activity and potential for performance improvements through upgrades suggest moderate growth potential, despite uncertain price direction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest a hold position, with no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate reduced demand for stablecoins, suggesting a potential rotation into riskier assets."
2024-08-14 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, with the S&P 500 maintaining strength, suggesting a relatively stable risk appetite. Bitcoin is seeing increased institutional interest with significant investments in spot ETFs, which could signal growing confidence in the asset. Ethereum's shift towards inflationary supply might dampen its appeal in the short term, while Solana's network activity surge and potential technical breakout present a mixed outlook. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance, and Tether's large outflows from exchanges indicate a potential shift in liquidity preferences among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional investments in Bitcoin ETFs indicate strong confidence and potential for upward momentum, despite current technical signals being neutral.

ETH: 0.0 — The shift towards inflationary supply and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance, with no immediate catalysts for a price move.

SOL: +0.5 — Record on-chain activity and potential for a technical breakout provide a positive outlook, despite mixed sentiment in the broader market.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — The large outflows from exchanges suggest a shift away from stablecoins, possibly indicating a slight increase in risk appetite among investors."
2024-08-15 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, and its futures trading suggests limited conviction among traders. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with a bearish pattern identified, though it holds a key support level that could prompt a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, indicating a stable but unremarkable position. Tether faces potential regulatory risks, though its recent investment in a fintech company suggests ongoing strategic expansion. Overall, the macroeconomic environment is stable, but the crypto market is showing signs of hesitation, with no clear bullish signals across the major assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and sideways futures trading indicate bearish sentiment, suggesting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish technical patterns, ETH holds a key support level, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.1 — Stable price movements and lack of significant news suggest a slight preference for holding, given its relative stability.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher stablecoin exposure is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which has seen a sharp sell-off. Ethereum is showing signs of potential further decline, as indicated by a bearish technical pattern, although it is holding above a key support level. Solana and Dogecoin have not been significantly impacted by news, but their technical indicators do not suggest any immediate bullish momentum. Tether remains stable, but faces potential regulatory risks that could impact its future stability. In this environment, a cautious approach with a preference for stable assets is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price pressure warrant a cautious stance, though support levels are holding for now.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to suggest a change in allocation; maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.6 — Increased market volatility and regulatory concerns in other assets make USDT a safer allocation for capital preservation."
2024-08-15 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent price declines and lack of strong buy signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip below $58,000 amid a broader market sell-off, reflecting limited directional conviction. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with a bearish pattern, though it remains above a key support level, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven changes, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. The market sell-off and sideways futures trading indicate limited upside potential in the short term.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish technical patterns, ETH holds above key support, balancing potential downside with rebound possibilities. Mixed signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Solana remains neutral. The absence of strong buy or sell signals suggests holding the current position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Low activity and lack of significant news keep Dogecoin in a neutral position. No compelling reason to adjust exposure at this time.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market environment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility and preserves capital."
2024-08-15 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price dip, retreating under $58K amid a broader crypto market sell-off, and futures trading indicates limited directional conviction. Ethereum is showing mixed signals; while a bearish pattern has been identified, it is also hovering around a key support level with potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but their technical indicators suggest a lack of strong bullish momentum. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, though its recent investment in a Kuwaiti fintech suggests ongoing expansion efforts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price dip and sideways futures trading suggest caution. While on-chain activity is high, the overall sentiment is bearish, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bearish technical patterns but holding key support. The potential for a rebound offsets the bearish outlook, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's slight price increase and stable on-chain activity suggest a modest positive outlook, though not strong enough for a higher score.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no major changes in data or sentiment and low on-chain activity, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a safe haven is prudent."
2024-08-15 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop, reflecting broader market sell-offs, and its technical indicators do not suggest a strong recovery in the immediate term. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, although it is holding above key support levels, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown minor price fluctuations without significant news impact. Tether faces regulatory risks, which could affect its stability, but it continues to expand its market presence. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable asset prices, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for stabilization.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish patterns, ETH is holding key support levels, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintain current exposure as market conditions are neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — Limited changes in data and sentiment, suggesting a hold position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market uncertainty and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral risk sentiment in traditional markets. However, the crypto market is experiencing some turbulence, particularly with Bitcoin's recent price dip below $58,000, indicating a lack of strong bullish momentum. Ethereum is showing signs of potential bearish patterns, though it remains above key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but both are experiencing typical market fluctuations. Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its stability and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain exposure but reduce slightly due to weaker market sentiment.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price dip warrant a cautious approach. Reduce exposure slightly while monitoring support levels.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a change in allocation. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite slight bullish momentum, lack of significant news or strong technical signals suggests holding current position.

USDT: +0.5 — With potential market instability and regulatory concerns, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-08-15 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a notable dip in Bitcoin's price and sideways trading in futures, indicating limited conviction among traders. Ethereum is showing signs of being oversold but is holding a key support level, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but their recent price movements have been slightly negative. Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, although it is expanding its footprint in the Gulf region. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility, which might encourage risk-taking if market conditions improve.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain current exposure but consider reducing if the downtrend continues.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite being oversold, bearish patterns and mixed signals warrant a hold position. Monitor for a potential rebound if support holds.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to suggest a change in allocation. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum signals in technical indicators suggest a slight increase in allocation could be warranted.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-15 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price dip below $58,000, reflecting broader market sell-off pressures. Ethereum is also under pressure, with technical patterns suggesting potential further declines, although it is currently holding a key support level. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven changes, but their technical indicators do not suggest strong bullish momentum. Tether faces regulatory risks, which could impact its stability as a safe haven. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable gold and oil prices, does not indicate immediate risk-on sentiment, suggesting a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price dip and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious stance on Bitcoin, though high on-chain activity indicates some underlying interest.

ETH: -0.4 — Bearish technical patterns and the risk of further declines warrant reducing exposure, despite holding key support levels.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and no strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance on Solana seems prudent.

DOGE: 0.1 — Despite a slight increase in price and bullish momentum signals, the lack of significant news or volume changes suggests only a modest positive outlook.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a safe haven is advisable."
2024-08-15 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip below $58,000, reflecting broader market sell-offs and a lack of directional conviction in futures trading. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with a bearish pattern, though it remains near a key support level. Solana and Dogecoin have shown minor price fluctuations but lack significant news or strong technical signals. Meanwhile, USDT is under scrutiny due to potential regulatory risks, although it continues to see adoption efforts. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and no major disruptions in traditional financial markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The market sentiment is weak, and the asset may face further downside pressure.

ETH: -0.2 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions indicate potential risk, though the proximity to support levels offers some hope for stabilization.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a strong directional preference. The asset remains neutral in the current market context.

DOGE: 0.1 — Despite a lack of significant news, DOGE shows some bullish momentum in technical indicators, warranting a slight positive bias.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent to hedge against volatility."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.23. The broader crypto market has experienced a slight downturn, with Bitcoin and Ethereum facing downward pressure. Bitcoin's price has dipped below $58,000 amid a broader market sell-off, while Ethereum is showing bearish technical patterns but is holding at key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have not seen significant news, but Dogecoin is exhibiting some bullish momentum. Tether faces potential regulatory challenges, although it is expanding its presence in the Gulf region. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a preference for stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The market sentiment is currently bearish, and maintaining a slightly reduced exposure is prudent.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite holding key support, bearish patterns and oversold conditions indicate potential further downside. A cautious stance is warranted until clearer bullish signals emerge.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate. There is no strong impetus for either increasing or decreasing exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators suggests some potential for upward movement. While there is no significant news, the technicals support a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential regulatory concerns, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT for stability and liquidity is advisable."
2024-08-15 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a recent dip, with a lack of clear directional conviction among traders, as evidenced by sideways futures trading. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns but is holding above key support levels, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven movements, but Dogecoin maintains some bullish momentum. Tether, as a stablecoin, faces regulatory risks but continues to expand its adoption in new markets. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a slight tilt towards risk aversion, as indicated by the recent price declines and the macroeconomic context of stable interest rates and moderate volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and lack of clear bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain exposure but reduce slightly due to market uncertainty.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish technical patterns, ETH is holding key support levels. Maintain current exposure as potential for rebound exists.

SOL: +0.1 — No significant news or technical signals, but slight positive price movement suggests maintaining current exposure with a slight increase.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators supports a modest increase in exposure, despite lack of significant news.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment and regulatory risks, increase exposure to USDT for stability and risk management."
2024-08-15 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a recent dip below $58K, indicating some bearish pressure. Ethereum is showing signs of potential bearish patterns, although it remains near key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but both have shown slight price increases in the last hour. Tether faces potential regulatory risks, which could impact its stability. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities. In this context, the market shows a cautious stance with a slight inclination towards risk assets, but with underlying uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Recent price dip and sideways futures trading suggest caution. Current holdings warrant a slight reduction to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite potential bearish patterns, ETH is holding key support levels. Maintain current exposure while monitoring for further developments.

SOL: +0.2 — Stable price with no significant news. Slight positive bias due to recent price increase and normal on-chain activity.

DOGE: +0.1 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators and recent price increase suggest a modest positive outlook.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-15 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt.

Ethereum is facing potential downside risks due to a bearish technical pattern, though it remains above a key support level, suggesting some potential for a rebound.

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price dip and sideways futures trading suggest caution. Despite some bullish momentum, the broader market sell-off and lack of strong buy signals warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with potential downside from a bearish pattern, but holding above key support. Maintain a neutral stance until clearer direction emerges.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a directional change. Maintain current exposure as market conditions remain stable.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite no major news, bullish momentum and increased transaction activity suggest a slight positive bias. Consider modestly increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — Regulatory risks are a concern, but in a cautious market environment, maintaining stablecoin exposure provides a hedge against volatility."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of bullish momentum, particularly in BTC and DOGE, as indicated by recent price increases and positive momentum signals. However, macroeconomic factors such as stable interest rates and a relatively strong U.S. dollar index suggest a mixed environment for risk assets. Bitcoin experienced a sharp dip recently but shows signs of recovery with a potential breakout, while Ethereum faces technical challenges with a bearish pattern identified. Regulatory concerns around USDT could impact its stability, although its adoption continues to grow.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, BTC shows bullish momentum and potential breakout signals, making it relatively attractive in a mixed market environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and bearish news suggest caution; however, ETH maintains key support levels, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent price increases and bullish momentum signal potential for gains, though lacking significant news, SOL remains moderately attractive.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and a breakout signal make DOGE appealing, despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and regulatory concerns, reducing exposure to USDT seems prudent as capital rotates into more volatile assets."
2024-08-15 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a recent dip below $58K amid broader market sell-offs, though it shows signs of bullish momentum in the short term. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, but it remains near key support levels, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown positive price movements and bullish momentum, though without significant news to drive further confidence. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, despite ongoing adoption efforts. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a cautious risk-on environment, favoring a balanced approach between risk assets and stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price dip, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. However, the broader market sell-off warrants cautious optimism.

ETH: -0.3 — The bearish 'rising wedge' pattern and recent price pressure suggest downside risk. Holding near support levels offers some hope for stabilization, but caution is advised.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong price increase and bullish momentum, coupled with stable on-chain activity, make Solana an attractive option in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.4 — Positive price action and bullish technical signals indicate potential upside, though the lack of significant news suggests moderate confidence.

USDT: -0.2 — While regulatory risks are a concern, the current market conditions do not strongly favor a full rotation out of stablecoins. A slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in risk assets."
2024-08-15 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with signs of bullish momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite recent volatility and mixed news. Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery from a recent dip, with bullish momentum indicators and a potential breakout above the upper Bollinger Band. Ethereum, while facing technical bearish patterns, is holding key support levels and showing signs of a potential rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have also demonstrated positive price movements and bullish momentum, although without significant news catalysts. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its future stability and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin is showing bullish momentum and a potential breakout, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum is holding key support levels with bullish momentum, but caution is warranted due to potential bearish patterns.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana has shown positive price movements and bullish momentum, making it appealing for incremental capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin exhibits bullish momentum and a potential breakout, though without significant news, warranting a modest positive stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2024-08-15 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish momentum observed in technical indicators across several cryptocurrencies, yet there are underlying bearish signals and external pressures. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price drop recently, indicating potential volatility and uncertainty. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, although it remains above key support levels, suggesting a potential rebound. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but show bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether faces regulatory risks, which could impact its stability, despite its recent investment in expanding adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility and a significant drop, BTC shows bullish momentum in technical indicators, suggesting potential recovery. However, the overall market sentiment remains cautious.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions. While it holds key support levels, the potential for further downside remains, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators and a lack of negative news suggest a favorable outlook, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and technical indicators support a modest positive outlook, although the lack of significant news keeps the confidence level moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With regulatory risks and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT seems prudent in the current environment."
2024-08-15 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $58K, which aligns with the broader market sell-off. Ethereum is facing technical challenges, with a bearish pattern suggesting potential further declines. Solana and Dogecoin have shown resilience in technical indicators, maintaining bullish momentum despite the broader market downturn. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, but its recent investment in a Kuwaiti fintech indicates ongoing efforts to expand its adoption. Given the current macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, the market appears to be in a cautious phase, with potential for further downside risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, recent price declines and sideways futures trading suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price drops indicate potential for further declines. Reduce exposure to mitigate downside risk.

SOL: +0.2 — Maintains bullish momentum with no significant negative news. Slightly increase exposure given its relative stability.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite recent price decrease, technical indicators remain positive. Maintain current exposure with a slight increase due to potential for rebound.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, increase exposure to USDT to preserve capital and manage risk amidst potential market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop, with futures trading indicating limited directional conviction. Ethereum is facing potential bearish patterns, although it remains near a key support level. Solana and Dogecoin have seen significant price decreases without notable news to drive sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but faces potential regulatory challenges, which could impact its future stability and adoption. Given the current macroeconomic context, with relatively stable indicators and low volatility, the market seems to be in a risk-off phase, favoring safer assets or stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent sharp decline and lack of positive news suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.5 — Bearish technical patterns and recent significant price drop warrant a reduction in exposure, especially given the potential for further downside.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price decrease and lack of supportive news suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage potential downside risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Significant price drop and lack of supportive news indicate a need to reduce exposure to manage risk.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safer haven and liquidity buffer, despite potential regulatory risks."
2024-08-15 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies over the past few hours. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, with prices falling below $58,000 amid a broader market sell-off. Ethereum is facing technical challenges, with analysts identifying a bearish pattern and the asset entering an oversold zone. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant price decreases, although there is no major news impacting these assets directly. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, but faces potential regulatory risks as highlighted by recent analysis from JPMorgan. In this environment, risk aversion seems to be increasing, suggesting a potential shift towards safer assets like stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent sharp price decline and lack of strong directional conviction suggest caution. Holding a moderate position is advisable.

ETH: -0.5 — The bearish technical pattern and oversold conditions indicate potential further downside. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market sentiment.

SOL: 0.0 — While experiencing price declines, there is no significant news or technical indicators suggesting a strong directional move. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no major news or significant changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance is suitable.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market sentiment and potential regulatory risks, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven is advisable to mitigate risk."
2024-08-15 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop, with futures trading indicating a lack of directional conviction. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, though it remains near key support levels. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but are following the broader market's downward trend. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but regulatory concerns could impact its future stability. Given the current macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, the market seems to be in a risk-off mode, favoring more stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish technical indicators, the recent price drop and lack of strong directional conviction suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent.

ETH: -0.4 — With bearish technical patterns and recent price declines, ETH appears vulnerable. Reducing exposure is advisable, especially given the potential for further downside.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure. The slight price recovery does not warrant increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical signals indicate no clear direction. Holding current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is sensible to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-08-15 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable sell-offs, with BTC dropping below $58K amid a broader market dip and ETH showing signs of a bearish pattern. Despite some technical indicators suggesting potential rebounds, the market remains cautious. Solana and Dogecoin have not seen significant news, but their price movements have mirrored the broader market downturn. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory risks flagged by analysts, highlighting potential challenges for stablecoins in the future.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent price increase, the overall trend and momentum signals are weak, and the market sentiment is bearish. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Bearish technical patterns and oversold conditions suggest potential further downside. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market environment.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals warrant a neutral stance. Holding current positions is advisable until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, maintaining the current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable dip below $58K amid a broader crypto market sell-off. Despite this, BTC has shown some recovery in the last hour, although technical indicators remain bearish. Ethereum is facing bearish technical patterns, but it is holding above key support levels, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have shown slight price increases, but without significant news or strong technical signals. Tether remains stable, although regulatory risks are highlighted by recent news. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no major shifts in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price volatility and bearish technical signals suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish patterns, ETH is holding key support levels, suggesting a neutral stance as we await clearer signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent price increases and stable on-chain activity indicate moderate potential for growth, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or strong technical signals keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential regulatory risks, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-15 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
