- **Bitcoin dips below $100 K amid tech-stock sell-off**
   Bitcoin dropped under $100,000, marking an 11‑day low, as caution spread from a downturn in Western AI-linked equities.
- **Selloff seen as “buy-the-dip” by analysts**
   Analysts describe the drop (over 4 %) as a knee‑jerk reaction tied to Nasdaq weakness and anticipated Trump crypto policies, but view it as a potential buying opportunity amid strong macro fundamentals.

- **Ethereum breaks support, signals further downside**
   ETH fell below $3,222, suggesting a bearish shift and increasing odds of a decline toward $3,017.
- **Price under pressure around $3,000 level**
   Technical outlook shows Ethereum hovering near $3,000 support, with sellers challenging that level and creating downside risk.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL price stabilizes near $250 support**
   After a 10 % fall from recent highs, Solana held around $250, signaling resilience with possible upside toward $280 if support holds.
- **Bullish long-term outlook: 5× upside by 2025?**
   Optimistic forecasts suggest Solana could rally up to fivefold—possibly reaching $400—driven by ecosystem updates and meme-coin activity.

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto.

- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
