**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
